The agenda, venue and speaker information can be found below. See you there! ----- Agenda:6:00pm: Doors open7:00pm - 7:45pm: Charles Martinot, Grab7:45 pm - 8:30pm: - Nick Dearden, Confluent8:30 - 9:00 - Pizza, Drinks, Networking and additional Q&amp;A ------ Speaker:Charles Martinot, Data engineer at Grab Bio:As a devops engineer, Charles experimented and ran production loads over the past 5 years with Mesos and Marathon, bare CoreOS and now Kubernetes. Now, as a data engineer in Grab, he works to find ways to make his teammates life easier by reducing the operational load they have to shoulder. Title:A highly available Kafka cluster in 5 minutes ? Running Kafka in Kubernetes. Abstract:We'll dive in the Kafka setup used in the Grab data engineering team, and see how running Kafka in Kubernetes relieves the operational load associated with maintaining Kafka clusters. ----- Speaker:Nick Dearden, Confluent Bio:Nick is a technology and product leader at Confluent, where he enjoys leveraging many years of experience in the world of data and analytic systems to help design and explain the power of a streaming platform for every business. Prior to Confluent, he led the data platform group for a leading online real-estate seller and was chief architect for a cloud-based financial analytics platform. His early career stretches all the way back through multiple data warehouse and business intelligence adventures to the green-screen days of mainframe banking systems. Title:Streaming ETL with Apache Kafka and KSQL Abstract:Companies new and old are all recognising the importance of a low-latency, scalable, fault-tolerant data backbone - in the form of the Apache Kafka streaming platform. With Kafka developers can integrate multiple systems and data sources, enabling low latency analytics, event-driven architectures and the population of multiple downstream systems. What's more, these data pipelines can be built using configuration alone. In this talk, we'll see how easy it is to capture a stream of data changes in real-time from a database such as MySQL into Kafka using the Kafka Connect framework and then use KSQL to filter, aggregate and join it to other data, and finally stream the results from Kafka out into multiple targets such as Elasticsearch and MySQL. All of this can be accomplished without a single line of Java code! -------- Special thanks to Grab who are our local organisers for this event.

It’s an economy powered by the Internet and other 21st century technologies – the cloud, mobile, social media, and big data.\n \nThis session will provide you a broad understanding of NoSQL . A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\", \"non-relational\" or \"not only SQL\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data which is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Motivations for this approach include simplicity of design, horizontal scaling, and finer control over availability. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages.\n \nCome join us to understand\n- What can you actually use NoSQL for?\n- What problems can you solve using NoSQL?\n- Which NoSQL product should you be using?\n- What are the advantages of NoSQL databases?","location":"Seminar Room 102, Innovation Centre, , Singapore","rsvp_count":29,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1856774474606304","group_id":"219467331408976","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"20 Jan 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-01-20T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-01-20T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"236784267","name":"DevSecOps January meetup: Plan for 2017 & Rise of DevSecOps","description":"** DevSecOps Singapore is free for anyone to attend ** Besides providing the great location for the meetup, Acronis will kindly sponsor food and beverages too! • Networking: 15 Mins • DevSecOps SG Updates, Plan for 2017 by Stefan (15 mins) • Permitting Devs to diagnose issues on Production - things to consider by Ram Narayanan (45 mins) Abstract: Permitting Devs to diagnose issues on Production When faced with a production issue, it is ideal if the person who knows to solve the problem is able to directly observe and solve. In most organisations, however, there are a lot of well-intentioned hurdles in place. It is tempting to workaround or discontinue such safeguards, and indeed, people often do.In this talk, we will discuss things that development teams need to take care of, so that they can get access to production without compromising security and privacy.

To kick off an exciting series this semester, we have two special guests delivering niche talks: Fazli Sapuan and Wang Chen. Fazli will be giving us an insight into the art of lock picking while Chen will be delving into machine learning. Read on to know more!\n\nDate/Time: Friday, January 20 at 6:45pm \nVenue: The Hangar by NUS Enterprise\nFree pizza is served before the talks!\n\nTalk 1: The Art of Lock Picking\n\nTalk Description:\n\nNot all physical locks are created equal--they come in a wide variety of different mechanisms as well as manufacturing tolerances. Every lock design has its own advantages as well as disadvantages. Special tools can be used to exploit the weaknesses in the locks in order to defeat them.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nFazli Sapuan graduated from SoC in 2016 and is presently working as a Software Engineer in Garena.\n\nTalk 2: Smart Enterprise Software Empowered by Machine Learning\n\nTalk Description:\n\nThe talk will cover 1) how latest technologies like IoT, Machine Learning and Deep Learning change business models and processes 2) smart enterprise solutions SAP is building using Machine Learning techniques and the Machine Learning Platform that enables such solutions.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nDr Wang Chen got his PhD in engineering from NUS in 2009. Subsequently, he worked in Singapore MIT Alliance, Texas A&M University, and Singapore Management University to continue his research in control, optimization and operations management. In 2015, Dr Wang joined SAP as a Researcher, conducting researches in the area of Smart City, Logistics and Transportation, IoT, etc. Currently, Dr Wang is leading the research activities in the SAP Innovation Center, working on smart enterprise softwares empowered by Machine Learning technology.\n\nOur Sponsors \n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by NUS Enterprise.","location":"The Hangar at NUS, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore undefined","rsvp_count":26,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1257124970992584","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"20 Jan 2017, Fri, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2017-01-20T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-01-20T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.29272,"longitude":103.77549},{"id":"236864680","name":"Azure UG - Windows 10 IoT Core & Azure Microservices","description":"Thank you for the support for the Azure IoT  workshop on Jan 7. It helps us to understand the audience interests and the focus. We are arranging one more event on Jan again to share some of the basics of Windows 10 IoT core. Last event we realized that many of you were interested to have hands on with the RP3. But some of the basics of Windows IoT Core were missing in our event. We are covering it in this session. Topic #1 - Windows 10 IoT Core development with RP3Speaker: Senthamil Selvan Details : In this session I am going to talk about Windows 10 IoT system requirements, setup and deployment. The session also covers basics of App development and deployment to Raspberry Pi3. I have few sensors which I will demo how to read and display it on the UWP app. Cover some of the App development strategy for IoT core.

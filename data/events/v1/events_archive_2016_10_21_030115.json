We’ll be going through the fundamental principles of graphic design and interaction design, and how they come together in the things that matter to you- hackathon projects, websites, resumes etc. \n\nThis is a workshop for non-designers to understand the visual language that fuels all great design. Participants will not be asked to design or code on the spot- this is not a CSS or Photoshop tutorial.","location":"The Nest Theatre @ Innovation Centre, , Singapore 63","rsvp_count":12,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1123089821103714","group_id":"219467331408976","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"21 Oct 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-21T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-21T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.3424038461538,"longitude":103.68446615385},{"id":"1101191043328375","name":"Friday Hacks #122: NUSMods v3.0 & Open Source","description":"This week is about some of the things our very own NUS students have been working on.

What goes into making a campaign viral? Are the stories we are telling respectful of the issues that we want to work on, and empowering to everyone involved? In this session, we will experiment with some approaches to build up part of our outreach toolkit.\n\n==\n\nOctober is all about the Future of Giving! Sustainable Living Lab and (these)abilities will be examining the trends affecting what motivates volunteers, experimenting with different messages to engage them and exploring how cutting edge technologies can help create strong volunteer relationships. Whether you are a volunteer, a volunteer manager or simply curious, you can’t miss this! At the end of this series, we hope that you will understand and be inspired by the principles behind inclusive design. We also hope that whether you are a volunteer or a volunteer manager you will walk away with a toolkit that will help you to manage volunteer relationships better.\n\nWrite us at chewlin.kay@sl2square.org if you are joining us!","location":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2), 1 Tampines Street 73, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":7,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1116510798404503","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"21 Oct 2016, Fri, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-21T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-21T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.29891,"longitude":103.85319}]}

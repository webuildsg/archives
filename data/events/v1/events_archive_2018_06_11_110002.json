The core idea of Infrastructure as Code is to manage all aspects of infrastructure in a codified way, via configuration or code, and to apply best practices of software development such as version control. This configuration can then be read by tools like Terraform to automate the provisioning and automation of infrastructure. We will talk about how Terraform works, how to plan changes to infrastructure, and how to automate provisioning. This can be done across low level Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, or Software-as-a-Service, all with a common workflow. For existing users of Terraform, we will talk about new features in the recent 0.11 and 0.10 releases.

The idea behind state channels is that we can make blockchains more efficient by moving many processes off-chain, while still retaining a blockchainâ€™s characteristic trustworthiness. About Counterfactual:We are building generalized state channels on Ethereum. We focus on researching and developing novel techniques for state channels that increase privacy; have support for parallel operations; provide verified, audited, and expertly optimised components; and that establish clear standards for how all of these generalised state channels will fit together into a global, multi-blockchain network where any user can easily connect to any other. We are focused on the long-term possibilities of the Ethereum project and blockchain technology. We will remain on the forefront of this field and actively support research and work done by others that build towards the decentralized future of the internet. We will actively reach out to and speak with projects in the Ethereum ecosystem and march relentlessly towards the best developer experience possible for our projects. Counterfactual is a non-profit research foundation funded by generous donations from individuals and companies, such as Vitalik Buterin and L4 Ventures.

The Story of Food Waste","description":"ArtScience on Screen: WASTED! The Story of Food Waste\n\nCan you imagine if every time you opened your wallet, a third of your cash fell out – and you did nothing about it? Consider the fact that one-third of the food grown annually for human consumption is never eaten – for one reason or another, it ends up in the garbage. That’s $218 billion – or 1.3 billion tons – of food annually. In America, families chuck about 25% of the food and beverages they buy at a cost of $1,365 to $2,275 annually. Yet at the same time, 800 million people around the globe are starving. It’s a problem – but one with no shortage of solutions.\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation supported Zero Point Zero Films and Anthony Bourdain to expose the magnitude of this problem globally, while showing simple changes we can all make to eat more and waste less. WASTED! The Story of Food Waste stars chef-heroes like Bourdain, Dan Barber, Mario Batali, Massimo Bottura, and Danny Bowien, and shows how any action -- no matter how small -- can lead to new ways of using more food, feeding more people, curbing environmental damage, stimulating technology and business, and ultimately improving the health and well-being of all citizens worldwide.\n\nWASTED! will showcase forward-thinking organisations and individuals who are already influencing the future of food recovery and demonstrate how eating empowers you, in the fight to solve one of the greatest problems of the 21st Century: GLOBAL FOOD WASTE.\n\nDates and Screening Times: \n19 – 30 September\nat 11am, 12.30pm, 2pm, 3.30pm, 5pm \nClassification: NC16\nRunning time: 90 minutes\nVenue: Expression Gallery, Level 4\nFree Admission on a first-come-first-served basis\n\nThis programme is screened as part of the Season of Sustainability that runs from August through September. Opening the season is a screening of Otter Town, followed by Sunday Showcase: Sustainable Idealism² with Temasek Polytechnic and the annual Singapore Eco Film Festival. Rounding off the season is the Asian premiere of Wasted! The Story of Food Waste. \n\nIn line with Sands ECO360° Sustainability initiative that strives to minimize our environmental impact, leading the way in sustainable building development and resort operations.  \n\n#ArtScienceonScreen #SandsECO360 #SeasonOfSustainability","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":24,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1952349338372598","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"19 Sep 2017, Tue, 10:00 am","start_time":"2017-09-19T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-30T11:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2862681050961,"longitude":103.85934988513},{"id":"jnsmrnywmbzb","name":"Hack && Tell Singapore at ThoughtWorks!","description":"Hack &amp;&amp; Tell is a show and tell meetup for programmers.

Customers need solutions to analyse more data more quickly and in a cost-effective way. “Edge computing” is the key.  In the edge data centre, customers are able to manage the big data volume and low latency needed for IoT data. The rapidly deployable solution provides an integrated monitoring system control of all IT infrastructure parameters within the edge data centre. This session will review the installation requirements, similar to those for a traditional data centre, but with solutions unique to an edge deployment. Physical protection, environmental and climate control in a secure operational environment can be solved by different housing options, such as stand alone, security room, container.

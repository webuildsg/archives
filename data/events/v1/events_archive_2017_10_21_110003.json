TensorFlow is an open source Python module that makes machine and deep learning fun and efficient. In this workshop we will first introduce what Tensors are and TensorFlow basics. We will then build some simple examples to understand how feature extraction works. After which we will cover deep learning with TensorFlow. There will be plenty of hands-on activities. \n\nThis 3 hour workshop is targeted for students and developers that already have experience in programming.\n\nSign up at\nhttps://goo.gl/forms/6bjbFOzBgQkNEW2D2","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS, , Singapore","rsvp_count":9,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/174880786402378","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"21 Oct 2017, Sat, 1:00 pm","start_time":"2017-10-21T05:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-10-21T08:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"}]}

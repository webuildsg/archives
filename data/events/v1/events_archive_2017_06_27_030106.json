Come and interconnect to the mesh of (bio)signals, microbes, and machines. Exchange brainwaves with Lucifer, play with tangible Wayang Kulit interface, immerse in psychoacoustic rhythms of shamanic drums. Taste a laksa dataset, eat your Facebook profile, learn how to become a Gut Gardener. Watch endless scribbling of the autonomous typewriter. \n\n\"Keep on going, on to infinity, folding and folding...‚Äù\n\nMicrobites of Innovation contributes to the debate on the role of human and non-human cognition in contemporary computer culture. Specifically, it addresses how our individual and social histories, cultures and experiences are shaped. Responding to the emergent conditions of a networked world, the curatorial premise posits that aesthetic practices should critically address current technopolitics and also create a space for ivresse whilst envisioning alternative perspectives. \n\nArtists: Miguel Escobar Varela [MX/SG] Daniel Sim Yong En [SG] Bill Hart [AUS] Robertina ≈†ebjaniƒç [SI] Wallace Lages [USA] Pablo Gobira [BR/USA] Francisco Marinho [BR/USA] Thomas Levine [USA] Rodney Berry [AUS] Adam Nash [AUS] John McCormick [AUS] Ruben van de Ven [NL] Isabelle Desjeux [FR/SG] Audrey Samson [CA/UK] Francisco Gallardo [SP/UK] FRAUD [UK] Jennifer Jamieson [AUS] Richie Cyngler [AUS] Hans Tan [SG] Darina Alster [CZ] Tiffany Sanchez [USA] Jinsil Hwaryoung Seo [USA] Gottfried Haider [AT] Nazare Soares [SP/NO] √òystein Kj√∏rstad Fjeldbo [NO] Amalia Fonfara [NO] Center for Genomic Gastronomy [USA] Diana Lindbjerg [DK/NO] Anatol Bologan [USA] Kitty Quitmeyer [USA] Andrew Quitmeyer [USA] Yannis Kalantidis [USA] Cheng Xu [USA] \n\nCurated by Marcia Nancy Mauro-Flude & Mark√©ta Dolej≈°ov√°\n\n*************************************************************","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":74,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1940801862822751","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"27 Jun 2017, Tue, 10:00 am","start_time":"2017-06-27T02:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-02T11:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2862681050961,"longitude":103.85934988513},{"id":"1388727694551442","name":"Code Clinic + TechLadies Study CS50 - 27 Jun","description":"Join us in this women-only Code Clinic and study group!!

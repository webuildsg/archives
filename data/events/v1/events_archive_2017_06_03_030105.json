Through Sound Meditation (1/3)","description":"\n\"Listen to the wind, it talks. Listen to the silence, it speaks. Listen to your heart, it knows.\"- Native American ProverbIn everyday's conversations we often talk but forgot to listen. We often speak, but forgot to hear.Our mind is a clutter of chatters and noises where wisdom doesn't come through.How do we have a clarity of mind? How do we clear the clouds inside our head?What does our heart truly say? How can we hear ourself? How do we connect better?Quantum Zazen is for everyone. It is a place of clarity and connection and where silence speaks the loudest.It is a place where we feel centered, balanced, and focused. It is a place where we know exactly where we are.If you'd like to have a clarity of mind, focus, direction, or answers to your own questions, this place is for you!In this series of Awaken Your Senses meditation, we will focus on our ears to listen to the sounds outside and inside our self.Find your inner strength to leap further in all aspects of your life.Connect to the silence, and find the loudest noise that calls you forward or drag you backward.When: Saturday, 03 June. 08:30 am - 11:00 amWhere: Berlayer Shade at Labrador ParkFree of charge!

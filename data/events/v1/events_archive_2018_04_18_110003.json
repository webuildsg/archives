Our third Meetup is on Wednesday April 18th from 7:00 - 10:00pm. It will be located at Hospoda Microbrewery in 180 Albert Street (Albert Court) #01-19. The closest MRT station is Rochor (downtown line, 300m, 5 min walk). Alternative MRT stations are Little India (7 mins) and Bugis (10 mins). The folks at Hospoda (www.facebook.com/hospodamicrobrewery) have been very kind to offer to host our second meetup. They are one of the few microbreweries in Singapore, and will offer their local craft beer to us at happy hour prices for the duration of the event. Finger food is available onsite, while meals can be purchased from neighbouring eateries, and can be taken to Hospoda. There has been exciting news in the recent weeks about quantum computing, so do come down and join us for a great discussion! Bring your curiosity, and do not worry if you are not an expert. There is no need to know anything about quantum physics, so don't be shy :)","location":"Hospoda Microbrewery, 180 Albert Street (Albert Court) #01-19, Singapore","rsvp_count":27,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Quantum-Computing-Meetup/events/249662293/","group_id":27343282,"group_name":"Singapore Quantum Computing Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Quantum-Computing-Meetup","formatted_time":"18 Apr 2018, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2018-04-18T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-04-18T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.30421,"longitude":103.850922},{"id":"249652238","name":"DevSecOps In Practice","description":"Software development is pressed for faster and faster release cycles with acceptable quality, budget and security. As movements like CI, CD and Devops aim to cut down on release cycles, it's security's job to help control the risk. The risk landscape is complex as modern development practices increasingly consume more and more third party code. Traditional methods do not cut it anymore - it's time for DevSecOps. This session gives an overview of how companies have implemented DevSecOps practices in their own delivery pipelines and how this can help increase developer awareness of risks affecting them. We'll walk an example CICD Pipeline and explore how security has been embedded as a part of it, how the movement is shaping up and how standards are starting to follow suite.

We are promoting this event on behalf of our community member. You must register with the event to book your seat. Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: Stream processing is increasingly relevant in today’s world of big data, thanks to the lower latency, higher-value results, and more predictable resource utilization afforded by stream processing engines. At the same time, without a solid understanding of the necessary building blocks, streaming can feel like a complex and subtle beast. It doesn’t have to be that way. Join Tyler Akidau, Slava Chernyak, and Dan Halperin for a tour of stream processing concepts via a walkthrough of the most easy-to-use yet sophisticated stream processing model on the planet: Apache Beam (incubating). This hands-on tutorial covers the basics of robust stream processing (windowing, watermarks, and triggers), with the option to work through exercises using the runner of your choice (Flink, Spark, or Google Cloud Dataflow). Prerequisite Knowledge:Familiarity with the high-level concepts in the O'Reilly Radar posts - \"The World Beyond Batch: Streaming 101\" and \"Streaming 102\" Basic working knowledge of one of the underlying execution engines (Flink, Spark, or Cloud Dataflow) Materials or downloads needed in advance:A laptop with the Beam execution engine of your choice (Flink, Spark, or Cloud Dataflow) installed and set up A GitHub account What you'll learn:Understand the foundations of stream processing and the ease with which portable streaming can be accomplished via the Apache Beam platform Explore a series of examples that help shed light on the important topics of windowing, watermarks, and triggers Observe firsthand the different shapes of materialized output made possible by the flexibility of the Beam streaming model Experience the portability afforded by Beam as you work through examples using the runner of your choice: Apache Flink, Apache Spark, or Google Cloud Dataflow Location: 323 Agenda: 1:30pm to 5:00pm - Learn stream processing with Apache Beam Speakers:Tyler Akidau is a staff software engineer at Google. The current tech lead for internal streaming data processing systems (e.g., MillWheel), Tyler has spent five years working on massive-scale streaming data processing systems. He passionately believes in streaming data processing as the more general model of large-scale computation. His preferred mode of transportation is by cargo bike, with his two young daughters in tow. Slava Chernyak is a senior software engineer at Google. Slava spent over five years working on Google’s internal massive-scale streaming data processing systems and has since become involved with designing and building Google Cloud Dataflow Streaming from the ground up. Slava is passionate about making massive-scale stream processing available and useful to a broader audience. When he is not working on streaming systems, Slava is out enjoying the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest. Dan Halperin is a PPMC member and committer on Apache Beam (incubating). He has worked on Beam and Google Cloud Dataflow for 18 months. Previously, he was the director of research for scalable data analytics at the University of Washington eScience Institute, where he worked on scientific big data problems in oceanography, astronomy, medical informatics, and the life sciences. Dan holds a PhD in computer science and engineering from the University of Washington. ****You must register with the event to book your seat**** Register here: https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-sg/public/register We are promoting selected sessions of this event as they align with our group interests.

See http://www.suntecsingapore.com/plan-your-event/space/floorplan-level-3/.  For many of us, December is the time to wind down and relax, catch-up with old and new friends, indulge in good food, reflect on how the year has been, and perhaps, complete a couple of Python MOOC courses that you have been wanting to take. For PyData Singapore, we will be celebrating our year-end meetup at Strata+Hadoop World 2016 and we want you to be part of it! It will be on December 6th evening, and it's free and open to all. Agenda • 7:00pm - 7:45pm Improving PySpark Performance: Spark performance beyond the JVM - Holden Karau Abstract: This talk covers a number of important topics for making scalable Apache Spark programs with a special focus on Python - from RDD re-use to considerations for working with Key/Value data, why avoiding groupByKey is important and more. The talk also includes Python specific considerations, like the difference between DataFrames/Datasets and traditional RDDs with Python and UDF performance. We also explore some tricks to intermix Python and JVM code for cases where the performance overhead of Python with Spark is too high. • 7:45pm - 8:25pm Using PySpark and MlLib - Juliet Hougland Abstract: Spark MLlib is a library for performing machine learning and associated tasks on massive datasets. With MLlib, fitting a machine-learning model to a billion observations can take only a few lines of code, and leverage hundreds of machines. This talk will demonstrate how to use Spark MLlib to fit an ML model that can predict which customers of a telecommunications company are likely to stop using their service. It will cover the use of Spark's DataFrames API for fast data manipulation, as well as ML Pipelines for making the model development and refinement process easier. • 8:25pm - 9:00pm Stream-1st Architecture, Apache Flink &amp; Other Emerging Technologies - Ellen Friedman Abstract: There’s a revolution underway in how people work with data. Streaming data is no longer seen as a special use case – and that’s good a thing given that streaming is a better fit to the way life happens. This talk takes a look at the benefits of stream-first architecture and some of the emerging technologies that enable best practices with streaming. These include message transport with Apache Kafka or MapR Streams, and stream processing with Apache Flink. As a top level Apache project, Flink has an active and growing international community. The Flink engine offers robust, accurate and highly scalable real time stream processing, and it also works in batch. We’ll briefly explore how these new approaches and technologies are being put to use in real world situations. Bios: Holden Karau is transgender Canadian, and an active open source contributor.

From 2.12, Scala targets Java 8 meaning less boilerplate and more direct translation to Java 8. This improves the Scala experience from start to end. Scala has been and can be used in many scenarios, from low level to high level programming. We'll go through some common and uncommon usages. William \"ScalaWilliam\" Narmontas began his Scala career as a contractor in 2013, working on a range of projects in news media, mobile payments, eCommerce, big data, deep packet inspection, online gaming and legacy application integration.

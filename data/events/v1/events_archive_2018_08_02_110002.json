Partnered With SP Group Blockchain—the technology that underpins bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies—has the potential to remake important aspects of the energy industry. The emergence of blockchain introduces a new measure of uncertainty at a time when the industry is changing rapidly due to renewable and distributed energy, energy efficiency, energy storage, and digitization. Given their potential to streamline transactions and cut costs, blockchain could help to remove pain points and friction throughout the power value chain. To unleash this potential, Energy Web Foundation (EWF), with support from some of the largest energy companies globally, was established to enable and accelerate the transition to a democratized, decentralized, decarbonized, and digitized electricity grid. SP Group is a Founding Affiliate of EWF and leading the development of one of the most compelling blockchain use cases in the energy sector with the world’s first blockchain powered Renewable Energy Certificate marketplace. Please join our Future of Energy session, presented by SGInnovate and in partnership with the SP Group, with Ewald Hesse, Vice-Chair of EWF as he shares his insights on the potential of energy blockchain technology. He will be joined by May Liew, Vice President of Innovation at SP Group as they discuss the global collaboration that EWF and SP Group has embarked on towards a clean and sustainable future enabled by blockchain technology.

Want to manage it better but don’t know where to start? Maybe you’re looking to release it to the world, but find the technical steps to get there a pain in the neck? Tyk’s here to help. (http://tyk.io/) Join us for a 90-minute API 'surgery' led by Tyk’s senior Solution Architect, David Garvey, (or, as we like to call him, our 'API Doctor').

All you’ll need to bring is your laptop and the URL to your API.* We’ll provide the rest (including our totally free open-source API gateway, either on-premises, or in the Tyk Cloud). By the end of the 90 minutes you will have: • Set up your API using the Tyk Gateway • Published a Developer Portal so that your API can be viewed by the world • Created API keys so that others can access it • Used policies to easily control API keys • Configured your API access settings, so that access to your API is always safe and secure • Understood how to read your API analytics • Benefitted from a hands-on approach so that you can continue to go forth and manage your API using Tyk’s free open-source software Please RSVP via Peatix. (https://api-surgery-aug.peatix.com/) Doors open at 1830 to allow laptop set-up and introductions for a 1900 start. The API surgery will close at 2030 but there’ll be time to ask final questions and mingle with your fellow API lovers until 2100. NB: This is a hands-on workshop with limited spaces to ensure you get the most out of the session with our API Doc. Grab a ticket to reserve your spot. Want to join but can't make this event?

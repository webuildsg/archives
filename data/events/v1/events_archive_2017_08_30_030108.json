Chris will begin with the recent efforts to predict forest structure as a function of resource limitations. He will then discuss a theory for compositional trade-offs in organism physiology across the scales of life. In both systems, Chris will show how we can predict the minimum and maximum sizes associated with particular living architectures. Chris will then draw analogies between these systems and urban scaling while pointing towards future directions for the developing theory of cities.\n\nSpeaker: \nChris Kempes is an Omidyar Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute and received his Ph.D. from MIT in physical biology. He has also been a visiting graduate student and postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and a postdoctoral fellow at NASA Ames Research Center. Specific theories developed for individual processes or contexts are important and useful, but finding general principles that apply across vast amounts of phenomena is a central goal in science. In the broadest terms, this is Chris’ goal, to find theories and principles that apply to a wide range of biological scales and hierarchies.\nChris generally focuses his work on biological architecture—which may include phenomena ranging from explicit biological morphology to metabolic and genetic network structure—as an intermediate between organism physiology and environmental conditions. Mathematical and physical theories lie at the heart of his methodologies to predict how evolution has shaped architecture and how this, in turn, forms a foundation for reliable predictions of environmental response and interaction. His work spans the scales of genetic information architecture to the morphology of microbial individuals and communities to the regional variation of plant traits and their feedback with climate and available resources. In so doing, he aims to connect these first-order trends to the limitations imposed by environments in order to predict specific evolutionary events and consequences. Several collaborations with experimentalists and theorists have led to models that inform experiments and assimilate empirical data in fields including single-cell experimental biology and forest dynamics.","location":"Value Lab Asia, Singapore-ETH Centre, #06-01, CREATE Tower, 1 CREATE Way, Singapore 138602","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/inspiration-from-biological-scaling-for-cities-structure-tradeoffs-and-ultimate-limitations-tickets-37404440689?aff=ebapi","group_id":"13784124142","group_name":"Future Cities Laboratory (FCL) at the Singapore-ETH Centre","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/future-cities-laboratory-fcl-at-the-singapore-eth-centre-13784124142","formatted_time":"30 Aug 2017, Wed, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-30T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-30T05:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"242619787","name":"AIRSWAP and the New Token Economy","description":"The project: In this presentation we welcome Michael Oved to discuss the popularity and power of a new class of digital assets called tokens. Tokens have been called the killer app of blockchain, as they’ve been used successfully in recent months to fund a growing number of promising blockchain projects and companies. We will then present AIRSWAP, designed from the ground up to support this new token economy as a decentralized, peer-to-peer token trading platform. By collecting and aggregating personalized orders from peers around the world, AIRSWAP users create and manage “personalized order books” to trade with privacy, security, and choice. AIRSWAP is based on the Swap Protocol, which can support a variety of decentralized exchange solutions including personalized order books. We believe this design will provide ample liquidity and competitive pricing for the new token economy worldwide.

About the Topics: • Benjamin will share his experiences on Reactive programming, which makes it a breeze to manage asynchronous tasks like HTTP requests but it's even more useful when it comes to complex software with a lot of moving parts. He’ll show how ReactiveCocoa and MVVM is used in his app to separate presentation and logic. He’ll also explore other cases where ReactiveCocoa excels over existing design patterns. • Maciej will share on his topic \"Review all the things!\": I have a vision, where unit testing and code review are a standard, not an opt-in feature in iOS development. I've been fighting a lot to introduce them at my workplace. Let me tell you what things get reviewed in other industries and why it is so.

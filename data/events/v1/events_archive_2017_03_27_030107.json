We will section cellular imaging and tissue imaging in this seminar with various speakers from A*STAR Institutes, Singapore General Hospital, Cancer Science Institute of Singapore and Institut Pasteur Korea.\r\nPerkinElmer Launches Vectra® Polaris™ Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System. This new multi-modal tissue imaging system enables researchers to gain a deeper level of understanding of disease mechanisms related to new cancer immunotherapy approaches. The Vectra Polaris system is part of PerkinElmer's Phenoptics™  workflow solution for quantitative pathology research, which enables exploration of the interaction between tumours and immune cells to obtain a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms.\r\nWith the release of the Opera Phenix (2015), Operetta CLS (2016) and Vectra Polaris (2017), PerkinElmer (PKI) continues to innovate at the leading edge of quantitative cellular and tissue imaging. By providing state of the art hardware and software, PerkinElmer strives to develop tools researchers can use to generate ground breaking discoveries in translational research in precision medicine, infectious disease, drug discovery and immuno-oncology. Today we will see how quantitative imaging is being used to answer complex biological questions. It is also a time to share ideas and build new connections as we work together towards our goal of improving human health.\r\nSo, come join us and RSVP now! *Refreshment will be provided.\r\n","location":"Genome Institute of Singapore, 60 Biopolis Street, Level 2, Seminar Room, Singapore 138672","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/imaging-user-group-meeting-tickets-32460372849?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11108961173","group_name":"PerkinElmer Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/perkinelmer-singapore-11108961173","formatted_time":"27 Mar 2017, Mon, 9:00 am","start_time":"2017-03-27T01:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-27T06:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"237407853","name":"TIBCO NOW 2017","description":" \n\n\nDigital.

I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed.\" Shimon Schocken, the author of the book talks about the course at TED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter and try out (better yet, complete) this week's course homework before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues! Book club is held at Tim &amp; Wei's residence: 244A Tanjong Katong RdSingapore  437032Singapore Doors open at 7:00, meetup starts at 7:30. Bring snacks and drinks of your choice!  FAQ Do I have to take Nand to Tetris Part I before taking Nand to Tetris Part II? From the Coursera course FAQ: \"Nand to Tetris Part I and Nand to Tetris Part II are two separate and stand alone courses. Although it is recommended to take Part I before taking Part II, you can take any of these courses, in any order that suites you.\" Feel free to ask questions in the SingaporeJS bookclub gitter room: https://gitter.im/SingaporeJS/discussions/bookclub Useful Links • NAND to Tetris website: http://www.nand2tetris.org/ • Get the book: http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ • Coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2","location":"Tim & Wei's Residence, 244A Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":11,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/238554671/","group_id":6363162,"group_name":"SingaporeJS","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-JS","formatted_time":"27 Mar 2017, Mon, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-27T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-27T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.30649,"longitude":103.895782}]}

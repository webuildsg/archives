While there will be one or two mentors to answer any technical questions you have, you need to be self-reliant as much as possible as this is not a workshop. \n\nIn this study group, we are taking the course, HarvardX: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science, on edX together. As long as you are taking this course, please join us even if you're just getting started! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª üí™\n\nTo join in this study group, please:\n\n1. Create an account on edX and enroll into the course at this link: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/info\n\n2. Start from Week 0 or continue where you've left off. As the free wifi we are tapping on at the cafes might sometimes not be that great, do watch the lecture videos before you come. \n\nFeel free to join us if you're taking another programming course that's not the CS50 course. :) This Ruby on Rails tutorial is pretty good too: https://www.railstutorial.org/book\n\nBring your fully charged laptop and we'll see you soon!\n\nNote: Please buy something at the cafe as we're merely crashing that cafe. We don't want to be kicked out! We're trying out different cafes in search for the most ideal place (spacious, good wifi, convenient location). Until the search is over, do be prepared to tether from your phone when we meet.\n\nPsst! This study group is for women only. :)","location":"The Daily Roundup, 1 Keong Saik Road #01-02, Singapore 089109","rsvp_count":7,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1356663244403563","group_id":"1684426788471164","group_name":"TechLadies","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/1684426788471164","formatted_time":"14 Jun 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-14T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-14T13:15:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.27908,"longitude":103.84139},{"id":"240541538","name":"Docker Singapore - June Meetup","description":"Talk #1 Speaker:¬†Scott Coulton Details:¬†As we are moving towards smaller units of applications or microservices containers are the most popular method to wrap and deploy the applications. The applications will need to be distributed and highly available, but what options do we have to solve this issue?In this talk, we will look at how to distribute our containerised applications. Not only on the orchestration layer, we will also look at secure communications on the networking layer and persistent data stores.

We have 2 speakers lined up for our June meetup! 1st topic: Cyber Technical Surveillance &amp; Counter Measures (TSCM) ‚Äì Looking at the physical attacks on IT Infrastructure using covert data taps and transmission devices. Traditional Technical Surveillance has changed from large audio and video eavesdropping devices heavily reliant on Radio Frequency to miniaturised devices that use cellular &amp; wifi. No longer do you need a static listening post nearby but you can access the covert feeds anywhere in world through cheap readily available technology. This talk will look at how the world of technical surveillance has changed, why it uses cellular &amp; wifi, what is a cyber TSCM, gaps in current IT Pen tests and how 5G will accelerate the threat. 1st Speaker: Jason Wells Jason is the CEO of QCC Global (Asia), a company that specialises in Technical Surveillance and Counter Measures (TSCM) and Digital Forensics. His 30 years of experience spans public and private sector from leading the:- Global team for Business Risk &amp; Control Management within HSBC Financial Crime &amp; Regulatory Compliance,- Corporate Security &amp; Anti Illicit Trade Manager in British American Tobacco in the Middle East,- UK military attach√© in Damascus, Syria or the Head of Overseas Intelligence team for the British SAS, special forces Having a honours degree in IT, was qualified as a CISSP and holds post graduate diplomas in Security &amp; Risk Management and Anti Money Laundering Jason has both extensive experience and technical expertise. 2nd topic:¬†Singapore Threat Brief The threat environment on the Internet is a constantly evolving arms race, and the activities of adversaries vary greatly by geography, industry, and even individual websites. As a result, security managers often seek the latest attack information that is relevant to their specific country and industry in order to predict what they should look for in the present and how attacks will evolve in the future. The Singapore threat report serves to inform approaches for security professionals to improve their defensive posture. 2nd Speaker:¬†Dawson Sewo (CISSP, ITIL, CCSK) ‚Äì Senior Enterprise Security Architect, Akamai Technologies Asia-Pacific &amp; Japan As an Enterprise Security Architect in Akamai, Dawson focuses on network security and application security.¬† He has more than 16 years of IT and security experience working in telco, managed hosting and cloud security companies.

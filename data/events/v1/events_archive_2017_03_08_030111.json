In this approach, the process is started by turning a requirement into a specific test case, then code is written to pass the test, and then the cycle is repeated by adding a test for another feature requirement. Benefits of TDD include faster feedback, reduced scope creep and over-engineering, and modular and maintainable code.\r\nIn this workshop, you will learn TDD practices and how to implement this approach in your own projects.","location":"StackUp Studio, 79 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-09, Singapore 139955","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/productivity-workshop-test-driven-development-part-i-tickets-32181030328?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11924664404","group_name":"StackUp","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/stackup-11924664404","formatted_time":"08 Mar 2017, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-03-08T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-08T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"237901602","name":"OrientDB - Graph Databases, Multi-Model DBMS and Game Of Thrones","description":"The Talk  Luca Garulli is the founder of OrientDB, the first Open Source Distributed Multi-Model DBMS with a Graph Engine.

Originally written by Michael De Hann, it's now acquired and promoted by Redhat and has an active community around it.  \n\n\nWhat can I do with Ansible?  •  Provision infrastructure components on cloud e.g. compute, network, storage and other managed resources such as databases, caches etc.  • Install and configure system and application configurations  •  Software  Change management •  Deploy an application, do rolling updates etc.  •  Run ad-hoc commands on a group of servers in parallel \n\n\n\nIs this for me?  This workshop is for you if,  •  You are part of the ops team (systems/operations/network/infra engineers) and would like to learn how to manage systems at scale and automate common infrastructure tasks.  • If you are a part of development organization/ DevOps team and are involved in automating application deployments and orchestration.  • If you are a QA/Test engineer and are involved in building test infrastructure/setups frequently and use scripts or manual approach to doing that.   What topic will I  learn? •  Ansible quick overview  •  The language - YAML basics •  Playbooks - writing infrastructure as a code with Ansible •  Modules  -  The playbook plugins \n\n\n\nWhat will I  do during the workshop? •  Setup a cluster of Ansible nodes with a controller and 5 managed nodes •  Write a simple playbook to install an application and start service using core modules • Deploy application to the managed nodes  \n\n\n\nWhat do I need to bring in?  •  BYOL - You bring in your own laptop.

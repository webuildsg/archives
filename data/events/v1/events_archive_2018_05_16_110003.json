SHAU has been taking part in the city’s new development under the visionary mayor Ridwan Kamil. It started with the Film Park under the Pasupati highway, continued with a series of Microlibraries –from Microlibrary Bima with 2000 reused ice cream buckets to the one with moss ceilings and edible plants – and Alun Alun Cicendo ‘Steel Plaza’ which is a redefinition of the traditional alun alun square typology in a contemporary format. Designing for Indonesia is an adventure which allows a certain kind of experimentation unfamiliar to the European context.\n\n\nSHAU\nSHAU is an architecture studio founded by Daliana Suryawinata (ID), Florian Heinzelmann (DE) and Tobias Hofmann (DE) in 2009 in Rotterdam (Netherlands), Munich (Germany) and Bandung (ID) which they expanded in April 2015. Their aim is to design attractive buildings and cities which are socially and environmentally responsible. Some of SHAU’s achievements include the 2017’s WAFX Smart Cities award from the World Architecture Festival, Small Firm of the Year in Sustainable Architecture from the American Architecture Prize, Architizer Jury and Public Choice A+ Award in Community and Architecture category, and recently the Silver Prize from Lafarge Holcim Award Asia-Pacific.\n \nFlorian Heinzelmann Dipl.-Ing. (FH), M. Arch., SBA \nFlorian received his Diplom Ingenieur (FH) degree in Architecture from Munich University of Applied Sciences where he and Tobias Hofmann received an Archiprix award; and a post graduate degree from the Berlage Institute, Rotterdam. Florian has worked for UNStudio, Amsterdam, most notably as a project leader for the Fraunhofer Institute project - Center of Virtual Engineering (ZVE) in Stuttgart, which received a Gold certificate of the German Sustainable Building Council DGNB. Florian is finalizing his PhD research on Adaptive Daylight Systems in large roofs under Prof.Dr.-Ing. Patrick Teuffel (TU Delft and TU Eindhoven). In 2009 together with Tobias Hofmann and Daliana Suryawinata, he set up SHAU. Florian has received several grants and is regularly lecturing at Universities, speaking on conferences and publishing research papers & articles. \n \nDaliana Suryawinata B. Sc., M. Arch., IAI\nDaliana studied architecture in Jakarta, Indonesia and obtained a post graduate degree at the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam in 2005. Her earlier working experience includes andramatin architects and Han Awal and Partners. She was a member of Arsitek Muda Indonesia in 2001-2002. After her studies, she worked as an architect for OMA, MVRDV and West8 in Rotterdam. Daliana has taught master courses at The Why Factory at TU Delft and the Berlage Institute. In 2009 she was a local curator for the 4th International Architecture Biennale Rotterdam with Prof Stephen Cairns. Daliana is a board member of the Indonesian Diaspora Foundation based in Washington. She also founded the Liveable Cities Taskforce at the Indonesian Diaspora Network. Together with former minister Mari Pangestu, architect Diana Ang and art manager Windi Salomo, she co-organized Kota Tua Creative Festival 2014.

By proactive discovering if your Windows machine is infected with malware, is the best way of protection. And this talk aims to empower every user by using a practical tool that is readily available for every anyone and quickly runs. • Old Skool Copy Protection by Aliz HammondAbstract: I will go into detail about how systems from the[masked] era - starting way back at arcade machines - battled counterfeiting by using custom CPUs, self-destructing hardware, and \"unusual consequences\" for the counterfeiter. Although such historical perspective may seem irrelevant in today's modern world, the simplicity of older computing platforms allows for a clear and unencumbered view of the principles involved. Many of the principles I cover are still used, albeit in refined forms, in modern-day tamper-resistent systems, and I aim to give the motivated viewer enough information to use as a starting block to breaking them. Speaker Bio:Michael RebultanMike has spent more than 15 years as an IT professional, DFIR and ICS/SCADA vulnerability assessor and pen-tester in an Internet Branch Exchange company. Aliz Hammond is a security researcher with side interests in hardware hacking and \"old computer stuff\".

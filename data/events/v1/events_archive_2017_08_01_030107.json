However, Linux server administrators must take the same caution that is appropriate with any network-connected machine to keep it secure and safe.\r\nThere are many different security topics that fall under the general category of \"Linux security\" and many opinions as to what an appropriate level of security looks like for a Linux server.\r\nThe main thing to take away from this is that you will have to decide for yourself what security protections will be necessary. Before you do this, you should be aware of the risks and the trade offs, and decide on the balance between usability and security that makes sense for you.\r\n \r\n\r\nAGENDA\r\n\r\nSetup AWS machine\r\nSetup SSH key\r\nLogin without password through SSH\r\nSecure and harden your SSH config\r\nUpdate your firewall to only allow access through SSH / HTTP / HTTPS\r\nSetup fail2ban\r\nChange your shell to fish and plugins around it\r\nInstall nginx and upload a static website\r\n\r\n\r\nMEET THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeerav Kumar \r\nSite Reliability Engineer, Cloudflare | Singapore\r\nFirst SRE hired in Singapore, my job involves setting up and maintaining servers across more than 100+ locations around the world handling, accelerating and protecting a significant portion of the internet and building automation; started the Singapore Docker Meetup around it.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nParticipants to bring laptop and credit card to sign up for hosting account \r\nParticipants are expected to have basic knowledge of the commander prompt in Linux or Mac along with Git Bash for Windows\r\n\r\nRESERVING A SEAT\r\n\r\nEnter the promotional code that accompanies the invitation email sent to you to reserve a seat.","location":"Innovation Room, 73B Ayer Rajah Crescent,  Singapore 139952, Singapore null","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/setting-up-and-securing-your-own-vm-private-server-tickets-35873017160?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11924664404","group_name":"StackUp","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/stackup-11924664404","formatted_time":"01 Aug 2017, Tue, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-08-01T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-01T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"}]}

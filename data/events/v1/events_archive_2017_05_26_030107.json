Why did I believe that?\"\n\nWhat if we can prevent regret by training ourselves to make better decisions? What if we can help others be more aware of the biases and pitfalls that affect our personal and national decisionmaking?\n\nCome join other changemakers, educators and makers as we draw on our experiences in understanding our biases, identifying conflicts of interests to build the Decisionmaking Chatbot. Over the course of 7 weeks, we will be using an iterative process to build the chatbot through:\n-Mapping out the conversations we want to have between the user -and the chatbot\n-Researching additional resources and topic areas for the conversations\n-Building the bot using publicly available software such as Dexter\n-Testing the bot with diverse segments of the public\n-Iterating and refining the box\n\n*For this week, we will be starting to explore Dexter, so please bring your laptop! \n\nWe will be debuting the chatbot at MakerFaire 2017 (22-23 July), so there will be a big audience for its launch! Come and be part of the effort to help each other be better critical thinkers. \n\n==\n\nOur meeting dates are currently:\n26 May\n2 June\n9 June\n16 June\n30 June\n14 July \n21 July\nEach session builds on previous sessions, so we strongly recommend that join us for as many sessions as possible.","location":"Starbucks @ University Town, , Singapore","rsvp_count":5,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/864944043669644","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"26 May 2017, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-05-26T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-05-26T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"240156162","name":"Learning to plan with deep neural networks","description":"Solving decision making tasks, such as navigation, often requires complex reasoning. Traditional approaches involve constructing a model of the task and planning. However, constructing accurate models is difficult. Deep neural networks brought unprecedented success in several domains. However, neural networks ignore the underlying structure of planning, and thus cannot scale to complex decision making problems. I will talk about recent research efforts that combine the strength of model-based planning and data based deep learning, such as Value Iteration Networks and QMDP-net.

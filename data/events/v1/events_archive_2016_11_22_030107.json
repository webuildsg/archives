Before we get into that, I would like to introduce with this beast called Docker.  For those of you who doesn't know yet about what Docker is, it is a container-based open platform for developing, shipping and running applications. Sounds simple right? But what's the benefits of it?  Besides some that were mentioned here, here, here and here, based on my knowledge and personal experienced: • Can be a replacement for Vagrant :)• Easy and fast way to spin-up any services you'd like, ie: Redis, ElasticSearch, Consul, you name it!• Isolated separate environment without interrupting other services. So on this meetup I will share with you about what Docker is actually about, how to create a basic Docker configuration, and integrate it with Drupal 8 so you can happily develop cool stuff with Drupal 8 in your local machine, fast and easy way. And perhaps we can discuss some other things too along the way. Sounds cool?! :) If it is, then please RSVP to mark your attendance, and I'll look forward seeing you all in 22 Nov. Cheers!  Ardi Note:We're not going to provide food or drinks this time since organizing it (and cleaning up afterwards) is time-consuming and seems to be one of the reasons we got tired of planning the meetups. So, we'll keep it simple and just focused on Drupal. But, feel free to bring snacks and drinks for yourself and for sharing! As always, we'll convene downstairs at the food court for dinner, drinks and conversations after the meetup. \n\n\n\nAbout Presenter / Facilitator:Pratomo Ardianto (Ardi) Ardi is senior web developer working at X-Team.

Here it is ...   Functions in dynamically typed languages, like JavaScript, accept inputs without types. This provides convenience but it is the developers responsibilities to provide the right input types to the functions during run-time. If the developers fail to do so, the program will most likely to crash and halt. On the other hand, statically typed languages like Java, check the types during compilation and fails when the input variables do not match the function parameters' type. Catching type errors early is good but it makes the functions rigid because the functions only accept the type (and its subclasses) defined in the parameters.  Generics or better known as parametric types in Scala provides the flexibility for functions to accept different input types safely i.e. type-safety. It provides information to the compiler to catch types errors during compilation. This will also reduce type related unit tests. The downsize to this is the complexities that come with the language syntax and behavior. This is just one of the many uses of generics.   Some of the take-home for this session are: - 1. A starting point to write simple and type-safe functions.   2. Reduce in runtime exceptions as a result of less class casting.  3. Understand some of the \"cryptic\" methods in Javadoc or Scaladoc e.g., def foldLeft[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) -&gt; B): B  About the speaker: A recovering Java developer who has keen interest in Functional Languages after knowing the good practice advocated by these languages.","location":"ThoughtWorks office, 87B Amoy Street, Level 3, Singapore","rsvp_count":71,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/235439163/","group_id":12690122,"group_name":"Singapore Scala Programmers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers","formatted_time":"22 Nov 2016, Tue, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-11-22T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-11-22T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.283051,"longitude":103.848541}]}

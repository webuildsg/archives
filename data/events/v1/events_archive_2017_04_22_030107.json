On, Saturday, April 22, 2017 we are out to set some records again! The story about #GlobalAzure is as unique as it is grand. Each year hundreds of organizers around the globe arrange Azure user group events on the same day.  April of 2013 we held the first Global Windows Azure Bootcamp at more than 90 locations around the globe. In March 2014 we topped that with 136 locations, and then again last year in 2015 we hit 182 locations! This year we are again doing a one day deep dive class to help thousands of people get up to speed on developing Cloud Computing Applications for Azure.

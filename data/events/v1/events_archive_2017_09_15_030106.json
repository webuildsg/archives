We present the remarkably simple theory behind Bayesian networks and then demonstrate how to utilize them for research and analytics tasks with the BayesiaLab software platform. More specifically, we explain BayesiaLab's supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for knowledge discovery in high-dimensional domains.\nAlso, while Artificial Intelligence is commonly associated with another buzzword, \"Big Data,\" we show that Bayesian networks can bring Artificial Intelligence to problems for which we possess little or no data. Here, expert knowledge modeling is critical, and we describe how even a minimal amount of expertise can serve as a basis for robust reasoning under uncertainty with Bayesian networks.\nThe workshop's examples can also be found in Chapters 4, 6, and 7 in our book, Bayesian Networks & BayesiaLab: A Practical Introduction for Researchers, which can be downloaded free of charge.\nProgram Overview:\n\nAnalytic Modeling: why do we build models, to explain or to predict?\nThe Bayesian network paradigm as a unifying framework.\nThe BayesiaLab software platform—artificial Intelligence in practice:\nExpert knowledge modeling and reasoning under uncertainty.\nSupervised & unsupervised machine learning for knowledge discovery in complex domains.\n\nWho should attend?\nBiostatisticians, clinical scientists, data scientists, decision scientists, demographers, ecologists, econometricians, economists, epidemiologists, knowledge managers, management scientists, market researchers, marketing scientists, operations research analysts, policy analysts, predictive modelers, research investigators, risk managers, social scientists, statisticians, plus students and teachers of related fields.\nPlease note that this seminar is geared towards applied researchers, NOT software developers, computer scientists, database managers, or IT administrators. Questions related to algorithms, programming, scalability, data architecture, infrastructure, etc., will be out of scope at this event. ","location":"Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre, Meeting Room 334 – 336, 1 Raffles Blvd, Suntec City, Singapore 039593","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/free-seminar-in-singapore-bayesian-networksartificial-intelligence-for-research-analytics-and-tickets-36556773293?aff=ebapi","group_id":"1616251112","group_name":"Bayesia","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/bayesia-1616251112","formatted_time":"15 Sep 2017, Fri, 1:30 pm","start_time":"2017-09-15T05:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-15T09:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"1430601017035235","name":"Spin A Snake: Make Your Own Zoetrope Animation (15 Sept)","description":"[SOLD OUT]\n\nFAMILY FRIDAY PROGRAMME\n\nOur fascination with motion and illusion is as old as the story of human civilisation. \n\nAlso known as the wheel of life, zoetropes produce animations through slits in rotating cylinders.

The workshop will start with an introduction to HTML & CSS before diving into coding the actual website that you can take home with you. The skills learnt in this workshop will allow you to make any kind of static website (i.e. a website that doesn’t require server-side code).\n\nAll you need for this workshop is a laptop and a text editor (like Sublime Text, Atom or Notepad++). You don’t need any prerequisite programming knowledge.\n\nSpeaker: Suyash Lakhotia","location":"The Nest Theatre @ Innovation Centre, 16 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637722","rsvp_count":64,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/121718955154465","group_id":"219467331408976","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"15 Sep 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-09-15T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-15T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.3421251123333,"longitude":103.68325381067},{"id":"117329918986746","name":"Friday Hacks #137: Internships, and How to Get Them","description":"This Friday, our very own coreteam members will be sharing their internship experiences both locally and overseas.

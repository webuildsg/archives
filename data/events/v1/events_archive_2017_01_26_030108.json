With todayâ€™s emphasis on speed and instant gratification, many woodworkers have jumped straight into using expensive power tools when using a hand tool could be a much cheaper, quicker and satisfying option.\n\nIn this introductory class to the Woodworking Basics for Adults course, we will be taking a skills-based approach to learning woodworking and will be making a beautiful wooden spatula for you to bring home. In support of sustainability, we will be using pine & kapor wood offcuts as our base material.\n\n- Improve your knowledge of wood and learn where to find tools & wood sources in Singapore\n- Use woodworking hand tools (chisels, spokeshaves, hand drills) with precision\n- Listen to your inner artist and develop a feel for woodworking\n- Make a wooden spatula\n\nClasses begin with a minimum of 3 people (max 6). This introductory class is the starting point to becoming a hobbyist woodworker. The full woodcraft course comprises 4 modules.","location":"Community Lab at United World College SEA, 1 Tampines Street 73, #01-D119, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":1,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1012810878863083","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"26 Jan 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-01-26T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-01-26T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.35782,"longitude":103.93187}]}

This enables radical redesign of business models, business processes and how people work. Understand from Mr. Rudolf some of the innovations in the business world and how real business value is created. Learn about internship opportunities in SAP Singapore where you work in innovation projects with these new technologies.","location":"Theatre @ The Nest, Innovation Centre, 16 Nanyang Dr, S637722, , Singapore","rsvp_count":15,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1833663406882091","group_id":"219467331408976","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"17 Feb 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-02-17T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-02-17T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"603214613202877","name":"FH #128: CyberSec - Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures","description":"We are excited to have Emil and Sunny speaking at this week's FH before we break for recess week. Check out more details below.\n\nDate/Time: Friday, February 17 at 6:30pm\nVenue: SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS\nFree pizza is served before the talks!\n\nTalk 1: My Love-Hate Relationship with Honeypot\n\nTalk Description:\n\nIn this talk, Emil will introduce what a honeypot is, discuss its applications, and demonstrate how honeypots are used in the industries and academia.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nEmil Tan is an active advocate of the infosec community globally. He leads and founded Edgis, an infosec special interest group in Singapore – dedicated to stimulate exploration of different facets of cybersecurity technologies and topics and contribution to the community. He also leads the Singapore Chapter of The Honeynet Project, a global project that aims to improve the security of the Internet.\n\nEmil has experiences in many areas of expertise in the cybersecurity field. He started his career as a researcher focusing in incident handling and intrusion deception. He later worked as a Security Ops Centre (SOC) specialist in the defence industry. Now, he’s working in the governance, risk management and compliance (GRC) industry. Emil is a regular speaker in infosec conference. He has spoken at 44CON London, BSides London and SyScan Singapore. He also regularly speaks at universities and polytechnics in Singapore.\n\nTalk 2: Web Security for Developers\n\nTalk Description:\n\nIn this talk, Sunny will go through some of the common web application vulnerabilities from OWASP Top 10 such as Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) and SQL Injection (SQLi) to understand why they exist in the first place and how to exploit them manually.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nSunny Neo is a Penetration Tester with BT Security, Ethical Hacking Centre of Excellence, a global team that performs security testing for various industries. Besides his day job, he teaches Ethical Hacking at Temasek Polytechnic as an Adjunct Lecturer, and is one of the CREST Assessors in Singapore. He is certified with CCT APP, OSCE, OSCP and GXPN. He has 1 year plus of working experience.\n\nOur Sponsors:\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by NUS Enterprise.","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS, , Singapore","rsvp_count":9,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/603214613202877","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"17 Feb 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-02-17T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-02-17T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"236843878","name":"\"Probabilistic­ Robotics and Self-driving Cars\" Presentation by Benjamin Choi","description":"Ben develops and implements algorithms for autonomy in unmanned ground vehicles at DSO National Laboratories. He studied Computer Science at CMU and there first became acquainted with the joys and frustrations of working with robots. Although his work is now robotics-focused, he remains interested in parallel algorithms, compilers, machine learning, and software engineering that can serve society. He also enjoys teaching and mentoring (especially if it has anything to do with programming). In his presentation, Ben will introduce Bayes filters and probabilistic representations of the world, and show how they are used to build components critical for robust self-driving such as localisation against a map and data fusion from multiple sensors (He will be drawing source material from publications from the Stanford Autonomous Driving Team and entrants in the DARPA challenges).","location":"SGInnovate, 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":136,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup/events/236843878/","group_id":21292690,"group_name":"Singapore Self-driving Car Engineering Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup","formatted_time":"17 Feb 2017, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-02-17T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-02-17T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.288118,"longitude":103.847542}]}

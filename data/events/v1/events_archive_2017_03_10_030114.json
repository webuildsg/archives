Attendees will also become members of the UnaMakers programme for collaborating online with UnaBiz and our solution partners.\r\nAbout UnaBiz and SIGFOX\r\nUnaBiz is an IoT company specialized in SIGFOX technology. As SIGFOX Network Operator, UnaBiz provides low-power-wide-area nationwide connectivity to SIGFOX Global IoT Network across Singapore and Taiwan. UnaBiz is also developing low-cost IoT solutions and providing SIGFOX integration services to system integrators and end-customers. \r\nWe will deploy a nation-wide IoT network in Singapore to enable LPWAN network which is extremely low power, long range, cost-effective and simple-to-use connectivity for compatible devices. This network will be an open and public network, giving qualified IoT channels, service providers, SME, large enterprises and government agencies equal access. The network operates on the 920-922 MHz range, and it will be:\r\n\r\nLong range covering the whole Singapore\r\nLow in device and subscription cost so that it can be deployed pervasively\r\nWireless and low power so that it can be installed and maintained easily on a very wide scale\r\nDoesn’t need pairing and SIM card so it can be connected easily\r\n\r\nThis will promote a vibrant and competitive market place for the IoT industry. \r\nSIGFOX is now deployed in 29 countries, covering 1.6 million km2 and 451million people, and connecting 7 million devices. UnaBiz was awarded the Facilities Based Operator (FBO) License from IDA on 21 October 2016. We already have about 80% outdoor coverage in Singapore.\r\nAbout UnaMaker\r\nUnaMaker is an online technical forum where UnaBiz Pte Ltd communicates with our solution partners.

This week we're really excited to have Virgil Griffith talk about the dark web, bitcoin and legaltech.\n\nTitle: Darkweb, Bitcoin, Ethereum and Legaltech\n\nDescription:\nI'll be showing a collection of recent work I've done in the darkweb, blockchain, and legaltech space.\n\nHighlights include:\n\n* I own and operate the world's largest search engine and proxy for the darkweb, http://onion.link, enabling all manner of analyses of darkweb content and traffic.\n* a system by which regulators can freeze bitcoin accounts.\n* an entrepreneurial graph to stand alongside the Erdos and Bacon collaboration graphs.\n* the very first graph of the Ethereum contract ecosystem.\n* an Ethereum powered light-weight replacement for commercial VPNs.\n* the potential of a domain-specific language instantiating a \"Periodic Table of Contracts\" to negotiate contracts between IoT devices and revolutionize the creation of smart-contracts and traditional legal drafting.\n\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nVirgil Griffith is a postdoctoral fellow at smart.mit.edu, contractor for the Ethereum Foundation, and cofounder of the Legalese opensource project. Virgil's primary interests are in smart-contracts/Ethereum, arcane corners of higher mathematics, and technologies that interplay privacy and transperancy for collective good. His favorite tools are information theory, graph theory, Haskell, and large harddrives. Virgil believes a rigorous formalization of obligation structures will bring about a global digitization with an impact of >1T dollars and is teaching himself deonitic logic and formal verification to make this happen.  Virgil received his PhD from Caltech studying info-theoretic measures of quantifying the functional complexity of neural networks. His Erdős-Bacon number is 6. A New York Times biography dubbed him the \"Internet Man of Mystery\".","location":"The Hangar by NUS Enterprise, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore 119613","rsvp_count":19,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1883428431941138","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"10 Mar 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-03-10T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-10T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2920833826065,"longitude":103.77563476562},{"id":"1336819859713168","name":"TGIFHacks #64 - Arduino 101","description":"Welcome back from recess week!

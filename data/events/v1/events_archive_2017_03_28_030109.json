Many try to adopt innovation methods practiced by startups (customer development, MVPs, validated learning, intrapreneurship, etc.) while some even try to annex whole startups through incubation and accelerator programs. Unfortunately, the outcomes have been a mixed bag. Lean startup practices are hard to implement in large organizations, and feisty startups rarely thrive within rigid corporate frameworks. This collaborative meetup series between NUS Enterprise and Design Innovation SG will explore if there is a better way for corporations to tap the entrepreneurship wave. We shall examine how Design Thinking strategies may be adapted to help companies better engage the startup ecosystem. Experienced innovators, designers, strategists and practitioners will be invited to share and discuss what did and did not work in their own innovation journeys. Seminar repeat every 3rd Tuesday of the month.  Please only sign up, if you are coming as the spaces are limited and bring your business card with you.

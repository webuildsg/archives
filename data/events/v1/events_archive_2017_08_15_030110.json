In this approach, the process is started by turning a requirement into a specific test case, then code is written to pass the test, and then the cycle is repeated by adding a test for another feature requirement. Benefits of TDD include faster feedback, reduced scope creep and over-engineering, and modular and maintainable code.\r\nIn this workshop, you will learn TDD practices and how to implement this approach in your own projects.\r\nMEET THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNathaniel Currier\r\nDirector, Engineering - Temasys Communications\r\nSpeaker\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an extensive background in both the technical and creative landscapes and nearly a decade of experience in cloud computing, Nathaniel brings unique insights into effective product development and scaling.

Now, with the proliferation of internet-based platforms and big data, the systematic treatment of online social networks is steadily gaining importance. This talk would introduce the audience to social network datasets, and help define and characterize the different types of data that get generated on such platforms. We will talk about ways to acquire, store, visualize and analyze such types of data for predictive analytics as well as causal inferencing, with a special focus on data complexities and challenges that are common in such networked contexts. Wherever relevant, code snippets and common tools will be demonstrated.\" Prasanta Bhattacharya holds a Ph.D in Information Systems from the Department of Information Systems and Analytics, National University of Singapore, where he studied computational social science. His broader research agenda focuses on the interplay between an individual's online and offline behaviour in specific contexts (e.g. social media, search engines etc.). He is currently working as a Scientist with the Social Intelligence group at the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) where he works on behavioural analytics.  • 8:00pm - 9:00pm Presentation: Updates •  Join us on Facebook and Twitter  https://www.facebook.com/groups/pydatasg/https://www.twitter.com/pydatasg Sponsors • O'REILLY MEDIA INC.  • Engineers.SG  • NumFocus ","location":"Google Asia Pacific, Mapletree Business City, 70 Pasir Panjang Rd, Singapore 117371","rsvp_count":250,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/235981787/","group_id":18509469,"group_name":"PyData Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/PyData-SG","formatted_time":"15 Aug 2017, Tue, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2017-08-15T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-15T12:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":29.991802,"longitude":-95.309677},{"id":"242134332","name":"Bootcamp: Learn How to Build a Bookstore WebApp With Ruby on Rails - 15th Aug","description":"We are teaching a free programming lesson for new beginners on how to build a bookstore web application with Ruby on Rails.

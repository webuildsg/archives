These will be working sessions which can include:Â  â€¢Â DataJams where data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis,Â  â€¢Â Clinics for social sector organisations to drop in and ask data-related questions, and â€¢ Planning sessions for wider community events.Â  This is a closed, by-invitation only session for volunteers whom we've worked with before. If we've forgotten you (sorry!) or you're new and have a burning desire to join these sessions, please send us a message! For others who can't make it regularly, these sessions are helping us have more community-wide events.

A large attack surface, low barriers to entry and good rewards make it a very attractive option for attackers. We are already seeing hackers try out new infection vectors like social media (http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/locky-ransomware-self-downloading-image-files/) and targets like IoT and PoS systems (http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/27/13758412/hackers-san-francisco-light-rail-system-ransomware-cybersecurity-muni). In this talk, we will demonstrate and show PoC exploits on how ransomware can move up the stack from desktop apps to enterprise apps using a novel attack vector of library dependencies and package managers. Protecting and securing your software supply toolchain is going to be of paramount importance against such threats. Speaker: Mark CurpheyMark Curphey is CEO of SourceClear, the security company for software developers. He founded OWASP (http://www.owasp.org) when he ran software security at Charles Schwab and has written chapters on software security in books published by Oâ€™Reilly.","location":"Akamai Singapore office, 1 Raffles Place, #16-61, One Raffles Place Tower 2, Singapore 048616","rsvp_count":21,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/SGSecurityMG/events/235899445/","group_id":821735,"group_name":"The Singapore Security Meetup Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/SGSecurityMG","formatted_time":"05 Dec 2016, Mon, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-12-05T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-12-05T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.28433,"longitude":103.851028}]}

In this session we'll see how we used the Jenkins Git plugin to integrate the product's sources with it's build automation, setup GitHub webhooks such that a Jenkins CI build is triggered everytime a change is pushed to GitHub, build specific branches and push build file changes back to GitHub during each build. Also see how we used the GitHub Pull Request builder plugin to build PRs and report status back to GitHub.

Our guests  for the evening are Jordan Dea-Mattson, Nuno Jonet, and Varun Mittal — together they have close to 50 years of cumulative product management experience. \n\n\n\nTHEME: AGILE IN MODERN PRODUCT ORGANIZATIONS Agile Software Development is a deep (and deeply misunderstood) topic. Some companies swear by it, and some, not being able to implement any of the methodologies properly, diss it. \n\n\nPANELISTS Jordan Dea-Mattson, VP of Engineering / TradeGecko Jordan is an experienced technologist who started his career in software engineering before most of the people in the Singapore tech ecosystem were even born. He spent over a decade at Apple, a large chunk of his career at Adobe and Yahoo, where he worked on large infrastructural projects. He recently joined TradeGecko as a VP of Engineering and is currently on a quest to evangelize better engineering practices in the Singaporean tech community. Nuno Jonet, Director of Product Management / PocketMath Nuno is a veteran enterprise and fintech product manager. Earlier in his career, he had a chance to work with Lockheed Martin, Fusion Garage, and Standard Chartered. Varun Mittal, Regional Head of Operations &amp; Merchant Product / helloPay, Alibaba &amp; Lazada Group Varun is an experienced fintech product manager, who spent most of his career working on an implementation of various payment systems. \n\n\nModerator: Uttam Chopra, Director of Product Management, Yahoo! Asia Pacific. \n\n\nAGENDA 18:30 - Registration starts. 19:00 - Registration ends. 19:00 - Quick intro about ProductTank. 19:05 - 20:20 - Fireside chat and Q&amp;A. 20:20 - 21:00 - Networking. 21:00 - Event ends. \n\n\nNotes: • The exact schedule is subject to change, but we’ll definitely start by 7pm. • RSVPs will close at 01:00am on Wednesday, November 16. • Remember to bring your ID for a smooth check-in with the building security. :) • IMPORTANT: Please be on time.

We will take a look at how to perform prediction using time series data, classify images and text using TensorFlow. At the same time, to introduce Cloud ML. Google Cloud Machine Learning is a managed service that enables you to easily build machine learning models, that work on any type of data, of any size. More details will be shared nearer the talk; meanwhile if you have friends/ colleagues who are into machine learning, this session will be interesting for you ! Karthik M Swamy will be leading the talk, he is a machine learning and computer vision researcher.  TensorFlow tutorials to be used in the session are available at: https://github.com/karthikmswamy/TFTutorials Installation instructions for TensorFlow for different platforms are available at: https://github.com/karthikmswamy/TFTutorials/blob/master/README.md Useful links :  Tensorflow - http://www.tensorflow.orgCloud ML - https://cloud.google.com/ml/","location":"Mapletree business City II , 70 Pasir Panjang Road #03-01 Singapore 117371   ","rsvp_count":100,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/GCPUGSG/events/235053108/","group_id":20085788,"group_name":"Google Cloud Platform User Group Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/GCPUGSG","formatted_time":"17 Nov 2016, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-11-17T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-11-17T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.272705,"longitude":103.801346}]}

BYO food, BYO drinks/booze.\n\nSome of us might be pooling money together to buy the usual Christmassy meat, ham and wine. If you're feeling lazy, let us know that you'd like to chip some money to the pot (suggested contribution: $30 to $50), and we'll settle the noms.\n\nAs usual, we'll probably be playing funny videos, nerf guns, and games like Cards Against Humanity. Other board/card/party games are welcome too!\n\nConfirmed food:\n\n🐄 4.6kg of beef brisket with chimichurri sauce (Kim Yong, Valentine, Benji, Alarice)\n🍖 Bone-in Virginia ham\n🐖 Pork knuckle\n🐑 Shepherd's pie (Clara)\n🍞 Sweet corn bread (Alarice)\n🌾 Christmassy cous cous (Alarice)\n🌽 Tacos (Andrew)\n🍟 Some form of potatoes\n🥗 Salad (Alisha)\n🍰 Cheesecake (Alisha)\n🧀 Random selection of the usual cheese\n\n🎩 Hat tip to Jörg, Aloysius, Hong Phuc, Ivan, Huiren, Kim Yong, Roland, Björn, Michael+Engineers.SG for their pledge and support!\n\nFAQ\n\n1) Is this open to members only?\n\nNope, this party is open to everyone in the tech community.

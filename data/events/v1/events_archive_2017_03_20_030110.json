We plan to have three sections to cover the range of experience that we hope will attend :  1.  Working with Images : CNN models will be introduced by Martin, from the basics.  And, if there's time we'll delve into ways to fool the network...   2.  Since he's in Singapore for FOSSASIA (a huge Open Source event this coming weekend), we've been able to grab Andrew Selle (from the Google Brain team) to talk about the work he's involved in.  Expect to hear about XLA and other techniques to speed up TensorFlow. 3.  For the regular \"aiming higher\" talk, Sam will explain the basics of one of the current hot topics : Generative models  and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), including some quirky variations. \n\n\nComing soon : \"Lightning Talks\" - where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10).  The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor.  It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner : Given the response we had to the last event, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.  Please suggest yourself here : https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/suggestion/ Quite a few people have already contacted us, but we know there are more out there!  Because Andrew Selle was added to the line-up at this late stage, we'll give everyone a bit more time (i.e. until the MeetUp in April...) \n\n\nAlso, since we *won't* have food, please plan to grab a bite before/after the event...","location":"Google Asia Pacific, 70 Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City, , Singapore","rsvp_count":243,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/237860964/","group_id":21982556,"group_name":"TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore","formatted_time":"20 Mar 2017, Mon, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-20T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"},{"id":"32844164781","name":"Fab Meetup: Exploring the Future of Our Past with Technology (20 March)","description":"Fab Meetup: Exploring the Future of Our Past with Technology\nFeaturing Tatjana Dzambazova\n\nAutodesk’s Technology Whisperer, Tatjana Dzambazova, is passionate about democratizing novel approaches for digital heritage preservation using technology, and turning them into immersive and interactive experiences of people of all ages.\nJoin us to hear about Tatjana’s journey – from digitizing coral reefs, scanning the Apollo 11, studying and 3D printing ancient baroque topologies – and how we can explore the future of our past with technology.\n\n\n\n\nBucephalus, horse of Alexander the great.

Farmers use it to grow their crops, scientists use it to understand our environment, and medical researchers use it to learn more about human physiology and psychology.\nToday, we live in a world where access to space is getting very cheap, due to miniaturisation of powerful technology and more efficient launch providers. There’s no reason why a couple of minimally funded entrepreneurs in a garage can’t become the world’s next billion dollar space company.\nMoonshotX is excited to visit Singapore as a part of our 2017 international roadshow! Come along to our Q&A night at LEVEL3 to speak with our founder, Troy McCann, about the opportunities of the New Space sector for entrepreneurs and academic researchers. Get a better understanding of the Gemini program, discuss your application, and find out what you can expect as a successful applicant!\nGemini is designed to be a very early stage international incubator, with a strong focus on the individual's development rather than accelerating a specific startup business. Local events are conducted in key cities, and collaborative activities orchestrated through online services between program zones around the globe. There is a strong emphasis on the formation of peer support on local, regional and international scales. We take no equity.\nIn October 2017 we are planning to run our second Gemini cohort in 15 cities across Australia, Singapore, New Zealand, Canada and the US.\nIf you have ever had a massive idea that you think could change the world, then do not miss this event!\nOne doesn't discover new lands without consenting to lose sight, for a very long time, of the shore. - André Gide","location":"LEVEL3, #03-22/24, 20 Pasir Panjang Rd, Mapletree Business City, Singapore 117439","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/its-not-rocket-science-how-to-get-into-the-space-business-tickets-36481105970?aff=ebapi","group_id":"14662429542","group_name":"MoonshotX","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com.au/o/moonshotx-14662429542","formatted_time":"03 Aug 2017, Thu, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-03T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-03T11:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"111490046169675","name":"Engineering the Innovation Economy with HOPE Technik","description":"Meet Singapore's engineering commandos - HOPE Technik.

Knowing how IT systems are planned and constructed helps you to understand the development process and the cost justification. Being able to understand your fellow IT collegues will certainly make a better team.\n\nIf you're someone already in the IT field, you probably already know about architectures. Knowing the 4 levels of architecture allows you to be an effective communicator, if your team/organisation still has trouble understanding one another. To speak in a team, requires common understanding of terms of words.\n\n===================================\n\nVenue Sponsor: Red Dot Ventures\nFood Sponsor: TribeHired","location":"Red Dot Ventures Pte Ltd, Launchpad@One-North, Singapore 139955","rsvp_count":12,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/197182374119251","group_id":"14934950373","group_name":"Singapore PHP User Group","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/14934950373","formatted_time":"18 Apr 2017, Tue, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2017-04-18T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-18T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2976399,"longitude":103.78792}]}

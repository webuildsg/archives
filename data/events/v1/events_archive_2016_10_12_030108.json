He also serves as an advisory board member of NVISO, a cyber security consulting company in Europe. Before starting his own company, Pieter worked at Ernst & Young and BAE Systems. He is also one of the Co-Founders of BruCON, one of the most awesome hacking conferences on this planet.\n\nHe started his information security career early in life and obtained the Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) certification as one of the youngest persons ever in Belgium. On his way, he collected a whole range of cyber security certificates (CISA, GCFA, GCIH, GPEN, GWAP) and is currently one of the select few people worldwide to hold the top certification GIAC Security Expert (GSE).\n\n-----\nStand a chance to win a free NUS Greyhats T-shirt at Security Wednesdays!

This short presentation highlights the best practices of modern day security that can be embedded into software development without largely impacting the cost or delivery timeline. You will realize the different areas where and how security needs to be addressed in the software life-cycle. The Rise of DevSecOps DevOps is a cultural shift for more and more organisations, bringing speed and innovation benefits that surpass other SDLC methods. But some of the principles of DevOps aren’t quite aligned with how companies of all sizes will need to incorporate and embed security into this shift. DevSecOps provides a path forward for the transformation and helps companies to shift security to the left so that everyone can take responsibility for it. While automating security testing is an obvious answer to secure applications in the code pipeline, that does not provide 100% coverage until security risks are fully mitigated. Fabian will talk about his journey in making DevSecOps a reality in an organisation. This talk will focus some of the lessons learnt - which includes implementing open source tools to help security team do their jobs better, hacking the culture, whitelisting services, reporting security defects. and also doing Red Team activities.

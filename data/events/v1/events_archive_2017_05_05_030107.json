In reviewing what we have learnt over the past few weeks, we will design games or interactive tools to open up new ways of conversing about complex topics. If you weren't able to join us before, this is a good time to come and catch ourselves up! This will also be when we begin to plan for our exhibition in May/June.\n\nAt the end of the series, the product we design will be exhibited in 2 HDB locations so we can share our insights.\n\nIf you care about civic education and the future of Singapore, start taking action today!\n\nPlease note that you will be signing up a series and not for individual sessions because the sessions are cumulative.

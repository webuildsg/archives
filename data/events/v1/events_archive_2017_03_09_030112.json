In this approach, the process is started by turning a requirement into a specific test case, then code is written to pass the test, and then the cycle is repeated by adding a test for another feature requirement. Benefits of TDD include faster feedback, reduced scope creep and over-engineering, and modular and maintainable code.\r\nThis second day of the workshop will demonstrate the TDD approach in more depth.","location":"StackUp Studio, 79 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-09, Singapore 139955","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/productivity-workshop-test-driven-development-part-il-tickets-32181305150?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11924664404","group_name":"StackUp","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/stackup-11924664404","formatted_time":"09 Mar 2017, Thu, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-03-09T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-09T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"}]}

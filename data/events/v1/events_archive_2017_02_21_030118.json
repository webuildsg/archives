Many try to adopt innovation methods practiced by startups (customer development, MVPs, validated learning, intrapreneurship, etc.) while some even try to annex whole startups through incubation and accelerator programs. Unfortunately, the outcomes have been a mixed bag. Lean startup practices are hard to implement in large organizations, and feisty startups rarely thrive within rigid corporate frameworks. This collaborative meetup series between NUS Enterprise and Design Innovation SG will explore if there is a better way for corporations to tap the entrepreneurship wave. We shall examine how Design Thinking strategies may be adapted to help companies better engage the startup ecosystem. Experienced innovators, designers, strategists and practitioners will be invited to share and discuss what did and did not work in their own innovation journeys. In the first seminar on 21st February at 6pm, we will explore &gt;&gt; how to bring Design Thinking into Organizations &lt;&lt; Jan from Design Innovation SG (https://www.linkedin.com/in/janauernhammer/) will kick-off the new seminar series in which many different speakers will share thier perspective and experience. He will talk about: The lessons learned from his time at Stanford University Design Group, in the Silicon Valley, Singapore and Europe and how Design Thinking in Start-ups and for Corporate Innovation can drive Innovation.  Please only sign up, if you are coming as the spaces are limited and bring your business card with you.

The projects have their source code on GitHub, with jenkinsFile checked in. The CI setup includes both automatic builds (triggered from GitHub) and 'self-service branch' builds. About the Speaker: Naomi Nayve works with Autodesk's Engineering Solutions team, and manages software build and release activities for several products. Most of her current projects use Jenkins and GitHub. She has over 7 years of experience in Quality Assurance and Software Configuration Management. She plays badminton in her spare time. 2)  Leveraging system Groovy to extract and perform Jenkins tasks – a Demo by Jonathan Koh This presentation will demo how Jonathan used the system Groovy script to automate certain tasks related to build records and artifacts which otherwise would be a high-effort activity each time. This knowledge is helpful in extracting data from Jenkins, and performing specific tasks on it, which can be extended to other applications. It comes with a disclaimer that script console and system groovy scripts need to be used with caution. Jonathan runs a dedicated Jenkins Master for one of the products he manages, which has some unique requirements such as high disk-space for artifact storage, among others. About the speaker: Jonathan Koh is a Software Build &amp; Release Engineer at Autodesk with over 10 years of DevOps experience. He uses Jenkins extensively in his current work, including designing complex CI / CD pipelines and administering Jenkins. 3)  Ask-the-Jenkins-Users – An interactive Q &amp; A, and discussion panel with Vishal Dalal, Kevin Sim, Naomi Nayve, Jonathan Koh &amp; Lata Kopalle. Audience can ask the panel questions on Jenkins – whether it’s on designing pipelines or Jenkins installations. Session is expected to be interactive, with other meetup members contributing as well. About the panelists: Vishal Dalal is a Principal Engineer with Autodesk’s Engineering Solutions team. He brings over 11 years of experience spanning UNIX Installers, Release Automation, CI/CD automations and compile expertise for open source projects. At Autodesk, he has supported and worked on several true open source components including OpenSSL, QT, Log4Cplus, TBB used by various Engineering teams.  He also manages Engineering Operations for several Autodesk products. Kevin Sim leads and manages a dedicated team of engineers which creates, operates &amp; maintains a continuously evolving Build Automation platform at Autodesk. He works closely with development and product groups to support common goals around CI/CD solutions.  He has over 11 years of experience in Software Configuration Management and QA Automation. Lata Kopalle is a Software Build &amp; Release Engineer with Autodesk. She has used Jenkins for over six years - administering several Masters, setting up and advising on Continuous Integration Pipelines on Jenkins. She has been a Release Engineer for over 12 years.

And our topic will be CHALLENGES. So, what is Open Space? \nOpen Space is a highly collaborative and where topics are generated on the spot and discussed through self organized breakout sessions. Although one can't predict specific outcomes, it's always highly productive for whatever issue people want to attend to. Some of the inspiring side effects that are regularly noted are laughter, hard work which feels like play, surprising results and fascinating new questions.— Michael M Pannwitz, Open Space practitioner Agenda: \n6:30 PM: Registration &amp; Food (Pizza)\n7:00 PM: Introductions \n7:15 PM: Introduce Open Space and topic generation \n7:30 PM: Break out into groups for discussion \n7:50 PM: Short Break \n8:00 PM: Second round of discussions \n8:20 PM: Summary \n8:30 PM: Wrap Up So come join us to generate some lively discussions.

And with good reason – well told data stories are change drivers within the modern organization. But how do we find the most important insights in our business data and communicate them in a compelling way? How do we connect the data that we have to the key underlying business issue?  The 1 hour session will cover:  * The essential elements of a good data story  * Chart design and why it matters * Common chart design errors  * The Gestalt principals of visual perception and how they can be used to tell better stories with data  * Some before and after data story 'make overs'  Kindly arrive at 6:30pm for a 7pm start.  About the Speaker  Isaac Reyes is a Data Scientist, TEDx speaker and lead trainer at DataSeer. He spends his time delivering training courses in machine learning and data science to companies in Silicon Valley, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the Philippines.

Apologies for the short notice! Please be advised about the change in location of the ThoughtWorks office! Please carry a photo ID to gain access to the building! Deploying Production Apps w/ Docker + Kubernetes  Kubernetes provides DevOps engineers with ways to automate the deployment of highly available applications. This session will focus on the best practices for deploying applications using Docker and Kubernetes. Attendees will learn how large production applications are using Kubernetes. They will learn how to apply that knowledge to move beyond configuration management solutions like shell scripting, Chef, or Puppet, and leverage cluster level APIs to deploy production apps to thousands of nodes. Attendees will learn how to deploy, scale, and update applications as well as how to keep them serving meantime.

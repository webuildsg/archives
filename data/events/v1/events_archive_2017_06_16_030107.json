Register on Level 4.\n\nAstronomer Royal Martin Rees invites you to explore the cosmos, imagining its origins and what the future might hold. In his signature style mixing humour and profundity, he encourages us to use astrophysics, and science more broadly, not only to make sense of space and time, but also to question the bigger existential reasons for our being.\n\nProgramme:\n5.00pm: Welcome Note by Honor Harger, Executive Director of ArtScience Museum and Jan Vasbinder, Director of Para Limes\n\n5.05pm: Introduction by Professor Bryan Penprase, Professor of Science at Yale-NUS College\n\n5.15pm: “Exploring the Cosmos”, Presentation by Lord Martin Rees, Cosmologist and Astrophysicist\n\n6.10pm: Panel Discussion/ Q&A with Lord Martin Rees, Moderated by Professor Bryan Penprase\n\nAbout Martin Rees:\nMartin Rees is a leading astrophysicist as well as a senior figure in UK science. He has conducted influential theoretical work on subjects as diverse as black hole formation and extragalactic radio sources, and provided key evidence to contradict the Steady State theory of the evolution of the Universe. He was one of the first to predict the uneven distribution of matter in the Universe, and proposed observational tests to determine the clustering of stars and galaxies. Much of his most valuable research has focused on the end of the so-called cosmic dark ages — a period shortly after the Big Bang when the Universe was as yet without light sources. \n\nAs Astronomer Royal and a Past President of the Royal Society, Martin Rees is a prominent scientific spokesperson and the author of seven books of popular science. After receiving a knighthood in 1992 for his services to science, he was elevated to the title of Baron Rees of Ludlow in 2005.\n\nAbout Bryan Penprase:\nProfessor Bryan Penprase is a Professor of Science at Yale-NUS College and the inaugural Director of the Yale-NUS College Teaching and Learning Center. Professor Penprase received both a BS in Physics and an MS in Applied Physics from Stanford University in 1985, and a PhD from the University of Chicago in Astronomy and Astrophysics in 1992. He was a National Research Council NRC Postdoctoral Fellow at Caltech, a visiting Downing Fellow at Cambridge University and held a Visiting Associate appointment at Caltech. Professor Penprase was a professor at Pomona College between 1993 and 2016, and was awarded the Frank P. Brackett Professorship in 2007. During 2012-13, he was awarded an American Council on Education (ACE) fellowship at Yale University, where he advised Yale’s president on STEM education, online learning and diversity initiatives, as well as co-authored the planning document for the Yale-NUS College curriculum. He also served on the Yale Summer Bridge Program Advisory Committee, and developed a conference on The Future of Liberal Arts in India at the RRI Bangalore campus in 2014. In 2016, Professor Penprase was inducted into the National University of Singapore Teaching Academy, which advises the university on matters related to teaching and learning, faculty development and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning. \n\nThis programme is part of the Art and Science of Space season and co-hosted with Para Limes – Nanyang Technological University (NTU). \n\n**NEWS: ArtScience Museum will be opening late this night till 9pm!

Why did I believe that?\"\n\nWhat if we can prevent regret by training ourselves to make better decisions? What if we can help others be more aware of the biases and pitfalls that affect our personal and national decisionmaking?\n\nCome join other changemakers, educators and makers as we draw on our experiences in understanding our biases, identifying conflicts of interests to build the Decisionmaking Chatbot. We will be using an iterative process to build the chatbot through:\n-Mapping out the conversations we want to have between the user -and the chatbot\n-Researching additional resources and topic areas for the conversations\n-Building the bot using publicly available software such as Dexter\n-Testing the bot with diverse segments of the public\n-Iterating and refining the box\n\n*For those of you who have built a preliminary bot, please bring your laptops. If you haven't shared the link on our Slack group, please do so. If this week will be your first time joining us, please comment here so I can invite you to the Slack group so that you can try the bots. Please explore Dexter too! \n\nWe will be debuting the chatbot at MakerFaire 2017 (22-23 July), so there will be a big audience for its launch! Come and be part of the effort to help each other be better critical thinkers.","location":"Starbucks@University Town, , Singapore","rsvp_count":1,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1783819261930407","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"16 Jun 2017, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-16T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-16T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"}]}

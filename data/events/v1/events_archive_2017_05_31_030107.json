While there will be one or two mentors to answer any technical questions you have, you need to be self-reliant as much as possible as this is not a workshop. \n\nIn this study group, we are taking the course, HarvardX: CS50 Introduction to Computer Science, on edX together. As long as you are taking this course, please join us even if you're just getting started! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª üí™\n\nTo join in this study group, please:\n\n1. Create an account on edX and enroll into the course at this link: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/info\n\n2. Start from Week 0 or continue where you've left off. As the free wifi we are tapping on at the cafes might sometimes not be that great, do watch the lecture videos before you come. \n\nFeel free to join us if you're taking another programming course that's not the CS50 course. :) This Ruby on Rails tutorial is pretty good too: https://www.railstutorial.org/book\n\nBring your fully charged laptop and we'll see you soon!\n\nNote: Please buy something at the cafe as we're merely crashing that cafe. We don't want to be kicked out! We're trying out different cafes in search for the most ideal place (spacious, good wifi, convenient location). Until the search is over, do be prepared to tether from your phone when we meet.\n\nPsst! This study group is for women only. :)","location":"The Daily Roundup, 1 Keong Saik Road #01-02, Singapore 089109","rsvp_count":8,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/133741557184028","group_id":"1684426788471164","group_name":"TechLadies","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/1684426788471164","formatted_time":"31 May 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-05-31T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-05-31T13:15:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.27908,"longitude":103.84139},{"id":"240026369","name":"Java/JVM Rockstars: Guillaume Laforge, Edson Yanaga and Burr Sutter","description":" == 1st talk: Guillaume Laforge on Apache GroovyGuillaume Laforge will be in Singapore for Voxxed Days Singapore.

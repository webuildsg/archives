As the number of items that are available as well as the number of users increases dramatically, it becomes a challenge to meet the specific need of each customer. Although recommender systems have been studied extensively, the problem of news and video recommendation in particular is complicated by the sheer variety of different topics and genres, as well as social and geographic factors that influence user preferences.  We are going broad in topic and looking at some of the tricks of the trade in Deep Learning, TensorFlow and Keras. You can expect to have 2-3 'long format' talks, which discuss tips, short cuts, and tricks for building, training and improving your models. And, as always, we're actively looking for more speakers - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10). The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor.  It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

Projection mapping takes that one step further by mapping the projected image onto a given surface. Combine that with electronics and you are able to create an immersive and interactive experience for the viewer.\n\nLast year, Leon Lim and Lynus Hee made a interactive table top using projection mapping software, custom motion graphics and electronics. In this talk, they will share how it was made and put together.\n\nYou can view a video of the project here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NHYFKV5uQ4\n\nLeon Lim will also talk about his latest project which is an interactive wall that is on display at the science center from 5th August to 25th of August.\n\nRegister Here\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/getting-started-with-projection-mapping-tickets-36645937987","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library, 6 Toa Payoh Central, Singapore 319191","rsvp_count":10,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1176717582474588","group_id":"14431580201","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/14431580201","formatted_time":"08 Aug 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-08T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-08T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.333655457879,"longitude":103.85050026199}]}

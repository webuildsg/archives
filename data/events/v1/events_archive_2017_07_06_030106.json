PLEASE NOTE: this event is geared more to people who are familiar with Deep Learning already and who are using (or are wondering about using) PyTorch for doing Deep Learning.  If you are new to Deep Learning then this is probably not the right MeetUp for you. Since it is the first event we will begin by going through a crash course of how things work in the PyTorch syntax for building models and how it differs from other frameworks out there.  We aim to highlight some of the advantages of using PyTorch for research and prototyping models (and some of the gotchas). We are currently looking for people to give talks : Both researchers &amp; Deep Learning enthusiasts who are using PyTorch and people who would like to present something Deep Learning-related (any framework) are encouraged to speak.","location":"Facebook APAC, 38 Beach Road, South Beach Tower, 189673, Singapore","rsvp_count":68,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/PyTorch-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/240312311/","group_id":23246531,"group_name":"PyTorch and Deep Learning Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/PyTorch-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore","formatted_time":"06 Jul 2017, Thu, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2017-07-06T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-06T12:45:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.295791,"longitude":103.854042},{"id":"240925787","name":"July 2017 Meetup","description":"We skipped a month, but we are back in July and we have some super cool topics lined up. Big thanks to Zendesk for hosting us once again! Agenda:7pm: Meet &amp; GreetWhile everyone arrives, we have the chance to chat and mingle, Zendesk is kindly sponsoring snacks and soft-drinks. 7:30pm: Talk #1: Deep Learning with Python in Finance by Ben Ball Abstract: Python is becoming the de facto standard for many machine learning applications. We have been using Python with deep learning and other ML techniques, with a focus in prediction and exploitation in transactional markets. I am presenting one of our implementations (A dueling double DQN - a class of Reinforcement Learning algorithm) in Python using TensorFlow, along with information and background around the class of deep learning algorithm, and the application to financial markets we have employed. Attendees will learn how to implement a DQN using Tensorflow, and how to design a system for deep learning for solving a wide range of problems. The code will be available on github for attendees. Bio: Ben is a believer in making a career out of what you love. He is inspired by the joining of excellent technology and research and likes building software that is easy to use, but does amazing things. His work has spanned 15 years, with a dual focus in AI Software Engineering and Algorithmic Trading. He is currently working as the CTO of http://prediction-machines.com  8pm: Talk #2: Introduction to MicroPython - Mighty Python Running on Tiny Embedded Boards by Ovidiu HossuAbstract: Coming soon! Hardware-hackers listen up! Ovidiu will give an introduction to MicroPython and bring a few of his boards to run some real-world demos. 8:30pm: Open AnnouncementsIf you have anything to share with the community, just grab the mic and spread the word :) ======================================= About Zendesk:  Zendesk builds software for better customer relationships.

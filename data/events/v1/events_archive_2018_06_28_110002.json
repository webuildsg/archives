Night 2018 Singapore - Sebastian von Conrad","description":"Registration link: https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/yow-night-2018-singapore-sebastian-von-conrad-june-28-tickets-46097087630 Details: Go Back to the Future with Event Sourcing and CQRS By Sebastian von Conrad Event Sourcing is an approach to building software with a long track record of success. By placing business concepts at the heart of our code, we can decouple systems into small services that can be quickly built, changed, and replaced. Although Event Sourcing has been around for many years, it remains outside the mainstream paradigm of software development--much to our detriment. With Event Sourcing, we place the highest value on the simple capture of essential business events without attempting to interpret them. We can then relegate all interpretations of those events to subsystems that are easy to build, change, and replace when necessary. The resulting systems have single responsibilities and are decoupled from each other, which makes them simple to modify. Event Sourcing can enable us to move faster by supporting rapid experimentation with new perspectives, new user interactions, and new insights into our business. Event Sourcing is agnostic of technology stack and language style, but it goes well with another pattern called CQRS: Command Query Responsibility Segregation. In this talk, we will do a deep-dive into both of these two patterns and discuss: What is Event Sourcing, and how does it differ from systems designed around current state.Interpreting Events into denormalised projections for very fast reads (Queries).Receiving and validating Commands that, if successful, result in new Events.Single responsibility services for reacting to Events by creating other events and, if necessary, triggering external behaviour.We will cover the advantages of the pattern, to give us an idea for when and why it makes sense to use it. But it isn't a silver bullet, and we will also talk about its disadvantages, including the most commonly mentioned downside: eventual consistency, and how we can deal with it. ABOUT THE PRESENTER: Sebastian von Conrad Sebastian is the VP of Engineering at Culture Amp and was previously leading the software architecture efforts at Envato, two of Australia's most successful tech companies. He is a former Software Engineering Manager and Software Engineer, and is an award-winning speaker at conferences in Australia and abroad, including YOW!, SATURN, Agile Australia, and RubyConf. A Swede by birth, Sebastian now lives in Melbourne, Australia. It was about the last place he ever thought he'd visit, yet alone live. After 9 years and counting, however, he has no plans to leave--at least not until he actually sees a snake.

Pentesters face multiple challenges before they can intercept traffic and start testing their target. Jailbreak detection, certificate pinning (hardcoded or HPKP), MDM solutions (traffic tunnelling), non-standard parameter formatting and client side encryption are just a few examples of such client controls. Many organisations fully rely on such controls and challenge pentesters to demonstrate their effectiveness. Using End-To-End (E2E) encryption as an example, this presentation will show that client-side solutions are largely ineffective and in some cases can even expose an organisation to unexpected risks. The presentation will show real case examples starting with a simple AES javascript encryption and conclude with more complex two-side encryptions wrapped in various encodings. Anton will also release a burpsuite plugin that helps to bypass such barriers and allows the discovery of vulnerabilities, which could be hidden for many years despite multiple rounds of penetration testing. • My Career as a Banking CISO by Geoff LeemingAbstract: Geoff Leeming completed his MSc in InfoSec in 1996, at the age of 25, and set himself a career goal of becoming the CISO of a Financial Institution by the age of 40. He achieved that goal 2 years later, and spent the next 18 years learning why it might not have been such a great thing to aspire to. He’s worked for some of the world’s biggest names in Investment Banking, run teams from Connecticut to Sydney, and worked through terrorist attacks, state-sponsored hacking, frauds, DDoS’s and that most dangerous of threat vectors: office politics. Join him for a non-technical run through of what to expect from a banking security career, hear some war stories from the front lines (no names will be named – except for Lehman Brothers), and get tips for success or survival. Speaker Bio:Anton BolshakovAnton is a Managing Consultant with ITDefence based in Singapore. He is a highly experienced security consultant having previously held the role of Manager in the Performance and Technology Practice and member of the Information Protection and Business Resilience Team at KPMG LLP and Senior Security Consultant at Dimension Data. Anton has managed and executed hundreds of security assessment projects across Government, Telecommunications and Financial Services sectors in the APAC Region. He is held in high regard by clients and his peers for his knowledge and skills in vulnerability identification and exploitation. Geoff Leeming is the co-founder of Pragma Pte Ltd, a specialist cyber-security consultancy headquartered in Singapore. Geoff has 25 years’ experience in CyberSecurity, specializing in cryptography, cloud security, security management and regulatory compliance, mostly gained in the banking sector, and a M.Sc. in Information Security from Royal Holloway, University of London. Originally from the UK, Geoff has been based in Singapore since 2004.

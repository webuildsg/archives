We are promoting this event on behalf of our community member. You must register with the event to book your seat. Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: Unifying the data team and the IT department is a crucial step for developing and deploying predictive data solutions in any organization, but communication between the two is almost always an issue. Pauline Brown analyzes the cultural, technical, and historical reasons that have led to a rift between the data team and the IT department and explains how rethinking the process can change the game. Technical reasons: Data scientists and IT team members (engineers and developers) aren’t trained with the same tools or programming languages, and these languages don’t coexist or work well together. IT teams have used historical tool stacks, technologies, and languages that are almost part of their religion—things that have already proven a certain stability in the enterprise, but young data scientists are showing up with newer languages like R or Python and using open source technologies. Neither IT nor DS teams want (or have the time) to learn a new way to think and program. Thus, the very nature of their collaboration can cause issues. IT teams typically don’t want the data science team to use “technology X” because they don’t want to deal with running it into production or risk breaking a cluster and having to restart it manually. This in turn limits the effectiveness of the data science team and causes frustrations on both ends. Cultural reasons: The difference between the two types of teams stems from the nature of the expectations—data scientists are expected to explore and discover, whereas IT teams are expected to maintain stability and keep things running. If a data scientist breaks something in their analysis, the repercussions are usually relatively low impact. If an engineer breaks something in production, this could have dramatic effects (only a few hours of downtime for an ecommerce website’s search engine could cost millions of dollars in loss of sales). Furthermore, data scientists are on the bleeding edge—in order to discover new patterns and build impactful, data-driven innovations, they want to access and collect all the data they can get their hands on and use all the technologies that can help them get there. But setting up ways to collect new data, giving access to X logs, or installing new technological stacks on existing frameworks requires more work from the IT teams who’ve set up the actual data systems in the first place. The two visions, approaches, and expectations have trouble coexisting. Historical reasons: IT/engineering teams have existed in big companies for 20+ years in some cases. They are part of the old and proven establishment, following the mindset “if it isn’t broken, don’t touch it.” Data science teams have only existed for the past 5 years, and yet they are treated like royalty, whereas IT teams tend to be treated as a maintenance team or as a simple commodity. In reality, however, data scientists truly depend on IT teams to give them access to data, help them install new tech stacks, or implement their work in production. Without IT teams, most organisations would not function, and data science teams could not run their projects in production and therefore not prove the value that their work brings to the company. Consequently, both companies and data science teams are truly dependent on IT teams, but IT teams are usually not valued as such. The solution? Hybrid teams made of data scientists and engineers that are themselves responsible for running models in production. Prerequisite Knowledge:A basic understanding of how advanced analytic solutions (ie. data products and machine-learning-driven solutions) are actually built and the process required for them to be deployed What you'll learn:Understand why building and deploying advanced analytics solutions on an enterprise level requires collaboration of people and of technologies beyond data scientists Location: 328/329 Agenda: 11:15am to 11:55am - The barriers to production: A tech problem or a cultural one? Speaker: Pauline Brown is director of marketing at Dataiku, which has developed the most productive predictive services development platform for data professionals, Data Science Studio (DSS). Pauline is a firm believer that the data and predictive analytics ecosystem is entering a new era; one in which even nontechnical members of the data team can transform raw data into business-impacting solutions. After all, as a marketer at Dataiku, data-driven projects in DSS are part of her daily routine. Born and raised in Palo Alto, California, Pauline graduated from Columbia University before joining Paris’s IEP. ****You must register with the event to book your seat**** Register here: https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-sg/public/register We are promoting selected sessions of this event as they align with our group interests.

Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: In the world of data, the legend of the subject-matter expert has reached near-mythical proportions—a wondrous individual who would change the course of the company and, if the stories are to be believed, humanity itself, if only she had access to the data she needed. For decades, business intelligence companies have strived to make their products easier to use in the hope that they could finally reach this enterprise savior. But what if she doesn’t exist? Chris Neumann shares the lessons learned by the team at DataHero (acquired in January 2016 by Cloudability), which released the first BI product that empowered subject-matter experts to work directly with the data locked away in SaaS services like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Google Analytics. Chris discusses the team’s experiences bringing BI directly to subject-matter experts and shows that, contrary to popular belief, providing subject-matter experts with an easy-to-use UI and direct access to data is not always sufficient for a project to be successful. Using contrasting case studies, Chris presents a framework for determining whether a project’s target users are, indeed, subject-matter experts in the “mythical” sense. What you'll learn:Learn why, contrary to popular belief, providing subject-matter experts with an easy-to-use UI and direct access to data is not always sufficient for a project to be successful. Location: 328/329 Agenda: 1:45pm to 2:25pm - The fallacy of the subject-matter expert Speaker: Chris Neumann is big data veteran who has been at the forefront of data innovation for more than 10 years. He was the founder and CEO of DataHero (recently acquired by Cloudability), which brought to market the first self-service cloud BI platform. Previously, he was the first employee at Aster Data Systems (acquired by Teradata), where he helped create the big data space. ****You must register with the event to book your seat**** Register here: https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-sg/public/register We are promoting selected sessions of this event as they align with our group interests.

We are promoting this event on behalf of our community member. You must register with the event to book your seat. Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: Today, Apache Hadoop is deployed both on-premises and on the public cloud with the public cloud increasingly becoming more prevalent. The cloud provides some unique abilities, such as on-demand infrastructure, cluster elasticity, persisted globally available object storage, and pay-for-use pricing. This enables even more flexible and cost-efficient deployment options for BI and SQL analytic users of Impala but brings in some new challenges that need to be carefully considered to achieve optimal outcome. Alex Gutow and Henry Robinson explain how Apache Hadoop and Apache Impala (incubating) take advantage of the benefits of the cloud to provide the same great functionality, partner ecosystem, and flexibility of on-premises deployments combined with the flexibility and cost-efficiency cloud. Topics include: On-premises versus the cloud: What’s the same and what’s differentInstance types to consider for best performanceHow Impala can read/write on cloud-based object storage (S3)How to understand workloads in transient, hybrid, and permanent cloud clusters and what workloads are cost effective to run on the cloud versus on-premisesTuning and best practices for storage and instance choices that will help you effectively architect Impala clustersBI and SQL analytics with Hadoop in the cloudHow Impala performs in the cloud compared to alternativesRoadmap and what’s next Prerequisite Knowledge:A basic understanding of SQL and cloud principles What you'll learn:Understand the benefits and trade-offs of doing SQL analytics in the cloud Location: Summit 2 Agenda: 2:35pm to 3:15pm - BI and SQL analytics with Hadoop in the cloud Speakers: Alex Gutow is senior product marketing manager at Cloudera, focused on the analytic database platform solution and technologies. Prior to Cloudera, she managed technical marketing and PR for Basho Technologies and managed consumer and enterprise marketing for Truaxis, a MasterCard company. Alex holds a BS in marketing and BA in psychology from Carnegie Mellon University. Henry Robinson is a software engineer at Cloudera. For the past few years, he has worked on Apache Impala, an SQL query engine for data stored in Apache Hadoop, and leads the scalability effort to bring Impala to clusters of thousands of nodes.

Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: When it comes to data visualizations, we usually think of infographics. But besides data as storytelling, journalism, and dashboards, data has grown into a medium for expression for a large spectrum of creative output. Parametric design, algorithmic architecture, and rapid prototyping technologies have redefined the relationship between creator and artist tools. Contemporary artists are still struggling to find the language for a new contemporary output and practice in the post-Internet genre. The online world is bingeing, but it is also a rapidly changing. Artistic expression within the digital arts has brought forward critical examination of technology and its impact on society, such as surveillance and self-determination, and has often collaged quotations of all aspects of media and consumerism, questioning art market concepts like authorship and intellectual property rights, in mediums ranging from video, software, and websites to hardware, kinetic machines, and robotics. In some cases, the next generation of digital artists, responding to their own experiences of the online world, have affected what is being known as a staunchly Web 1.0 aesthetic. At the same time, parametric or generative art is being created from algorithms without direct human intervention. Heather Dewey-Hagborg and Joerg Blumtritt illustrate current developments with examples of recent bodies of work and discuss possible routes of art driven by data and algorithms. What you'll learn:Understand current developments of art driven by data and algorithms Location: 310/311 Agenda: 4:15pm to 4:55pm - Algorithmic art and data creativity Speakers: Joerg Blumtritt is the founder and CEO of Datarella, a computational social science startup delivering mobile analytics, self-tracking solutions, and data science consulting. After graduating from university with a thesis on machine learning, Joerg worked as a researcher in behavioral sciences, focused on nonverbal communication. His projects have been funded by an EU commission, the German federal government, and the Max Planck Society. He subsequently ran marketing and research teams for TV networks ProSiebenSat.1 and RTL II and magazine publisher Hubert Burda Media.

Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: Building a data lake involves more than installing and using Hadoop. The focus in the market has been on all the different technology components, ignoring the more important part: the data architecture that the code implements, which lies at the core of the system. Just like a data warehouse, a data lake has a data architecture. If you expect any longevity from the platform, the architecture should be designed rather than accidental. But what are the design principles that lead to good functional design and a workable data architecture? What are the assumptions that limit old approaches? How can one integrate with or migrate from the older environments? How does this affect an organization’s data management? Answering these questions is key to building long-term infrastructure. The goal in most organizations is to build multiuse data infrastructure that is not subject to past constraints. Mark Madsen discusses hidden design assumptions, reviews design principles to apply when building multiuse data infrastructure, and provides a reference architecture. This reference architecture has been used across many organizations to work toward a unified analytic infrastructure. Prerequisite Knowledge:A basic understanding of databases (relational and nonrelational), system architectures, and how data is used in an organization What you'll learn:Learn a reference architecture to help understand when to save immutable data, when to standardize it, and how to manage its delivery and use over time Location: Summit 2 Agenda: 5:05pm to 5:45pm - Organizing the data lake Speaker: Mark Madsen is a research analyst at Third Nature, where he advises companies on data strategy and technology planning. Mark has designed analysis, data collection, and data management infrastructure for companies worldwide. He focuses on two types of work: the business applications of data and guiding the construction of data infrastructure. As a result, Mark does as much information strategy and IT architecture work as he does performance management and analytics. ****You must register with the event to book your seat**** Register here: https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-sg/public/register We are promoting selected sessions of this event as they align with our group interests.

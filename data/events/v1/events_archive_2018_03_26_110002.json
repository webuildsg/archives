Kleros uses blockchain and crowdsourced jurors to adjudicate disputes in a fast, secure and affordable way. Kleros connects users who need to solve disputes with jurors who have the right skills to solve them. Crowdsourcing taps into a global pool of jurors. Blockchain technology guarantees evidence integrity, transparency in jury selection and incentives for honest rulings. The speakers will cover:- Why the blockchain ecosystem needs an arbitration system- The main use cases- Game theory for creating the right incentives for jurors- Random number generation Speakers:Federico Ast graduated in economics and philosophy from the University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). He is a technology entrepreneur with experience in digital media, real estate and education industries. He holds a PhD in management from IAE Business School. He was a participant at Singularity University Global Solutions Program in 2016. He hosts a Coursera program on blockchain. He is a TEDx speaker. Clément Lesaege holds a degree in computer science engineering from UTC (France) and a master of science in computer science from Georgia Tech (United States). He started playing with blockchain technology in 2013. He has worked as smart contract security auditor focused on vulnerability detection. His research focuses on Random Numbers Generation (RNG) and game theory applied to dispute resolution.","location":"Paypal Innovation Lab, 5 Temasek Boulevard #07-01, Suntec Tower 5, Singapore, 038985","rsvp_count":172,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/248457274/","group_id":18519858,"group_name":"Ethereum Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore","formatted_time":"26 Mar 2018, Mon, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-03-26T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-03-26T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.294551,"longitude":103.858253},{"id":"248768784","name":"Turning Software into Computer Chips","description":"TOPIC: Turning Software into Computer Chips -- Hastlayer Software is flexible, specialized hardware is extremely fast. So why not write software, then turn it into a computer chip? This is what Hastlayer (https://hastlayer.com) does by transforming .NET software into electronic circuits. The result is faster and uses less power while you simply keep on writing software. You may not be able to tell just by looking at it but behind some function calls now actually embedded hardware is working! (You wonder how? Check out what FPGAs are!) In this demo-packed session we'll get an overview of what Hastlayer is, why it is useful for developers like you and how to write Hastlayer-compatible software. ============================ SPEAKER: Zoltán Lehóczky Co-founder and managing director of Lombiq Technologies (https://lombiq.com), originator of the Hastlayer project. His main expertise is in .NET software development and software architecture design. Core contributor of the ASP.NET Orchard CMS, guest lecturer at Óbuda University, John von Neumann Faculty of Informatics. ============================ IMPORTANT TO KNOW: YOUR PHOTO ID!

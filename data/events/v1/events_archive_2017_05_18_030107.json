Night: 10 Ways to Accelerate Software Development with Dave Thomas","description":"A major dominant concern for most software development is how to increase the productivity of development; evolution and/or execution. Systemic change in process and/or technology seldom result in more than an incremental impact on productivity and ROI. Increased value is best achieved by targeting specific waste/opportunities in the value chain by introducing an innovative solution. In this talk, we describe 10 techniques that are effective in accelerating software development. We discuss how one identifies optimal change points to impact both new and legacy code.

By modelling changes in an application as only events, they become the only source of truth. The events are then used for constructing current state of the system (in aggregate root), creating optimized view for querying (read-side) and propagating changes to other systems in asynchronous fashion (message-producer). In this talk, we will survey concepts in CQRS and ES, explain why Lagom might be a good candidate for your next micro-service, and highlight how data consistency within and across micro-services is addressed. \n\n\n\nAgenda: 7:00 -- Food &amp; drinks 7:20 -- Meetup group announcements 7:25 -- Venue / event host announcements 7:30 -- Presentation 8:30 -- Q&amp;A  Presenters: Joo Lee, Lead Engineer @ StashAwayJoo has spent last 8 years in finance industry as a software programmer developing front office trading systems for the investment banks like Macquarie, UBS and Goldman Sachs.

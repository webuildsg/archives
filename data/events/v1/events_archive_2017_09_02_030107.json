This time we focus on the theme of Toys &amp; Gaming for 3D Printing and will be featuring Ariel Lemon's customized toy accessories (mainly printed via Shapeways), Sean Suchanya's tabletop mecha game and a slew of other showcases of 3d printed tabletop gaming pieces. More updates will be added along the way and if you would like to showcase too, please feel free to drop us a line and let us know! Also, when you're here with us, do go crazy snapping pics of the stuff! Do also share photos on Instagram, Twitter, etc, tagging Shapeways using @Shapeways or #Shapeways!","location":"Funbie Studios, 70A Bussorah Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":3,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Shapeways-Singapore/events/242557187/","group_id":19108946,"group_name":"Shapeways Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Shapeways-Singapore","formatted_time":"02 Sep 2017, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2017-09-02T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-02T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.300898,"longitude":103.860031}]}

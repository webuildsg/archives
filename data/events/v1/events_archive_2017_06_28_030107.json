Complex database - driven websites like these need a web application framework – and that's exactly what Django does. Django encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source. Course outline:We will try to build a social news site like Hacker News from scratch. The completed site would support user signups, link submissions, comments, voting and a cool ranking algorithm. My approach would be to use as many builtin Django features as possible and use external apps only when absolutely necessary. In 3 hours, we might not finish everything, we will leave the rest as homework  Things to Bring: 1) Your laptop - For the hands on session during the workshop 2) SGD $20 cash - For payment of workshop tickets to cover expenses Venue Sponsor: Afflatus Singapore Resource Partner: StartupHax Pte Ltd Speaker : Shubham is part engineer, part data scientist and a full-time procrastinator.

Zendesk products are easy to use and implement. They give organizations the exibility to move quickly, focus on innovation, and scale with their growth.  Agenda:7pm: Meet &amp; GreetWelcome and mingle, enjoy some food and drinks! 7:30-8:30pm: Workshop: Django, GraphQL, ReactJS &amp; Apollo by Martin Brochhaus That's right, we will call it what it is: A workshop. Because it will be quite long... :) Martin is known as the CTO of theartling.com and luxglove.com and is currently in the process of migrating the entire codebase away from Django REST Framework and towards django-graphene (on the backend) and react-apollo (on the frontend). He will show how you can easily make use of these tools in your own projects right now - no big migration is needed, as you can gradually start using it for new features first and then gradually migrate old features whenever you have time. Martin will show how you can create your GraphQL schema in a test-driven manner, how you can query data from the database, how you can manipulate data using GraphQL Mutations, how you can deal with authentication and authorization and how to do validation of inputs and return form errors in a similar way like Django REST Framework does it. At the end of the workshop, we will leave Django-land and have a look at the frontend and learn how to use the newly built GraphQL API in a ReactJS project with react-apollo. Martin will demonstrate how to run queries and mutations, how to create queries with variables (i.e. IDs from the URL), how to re-fetch queries in case of network disruption and how to create pagination in astoundingly few lines of code. As always, space is limited, so please only RSVP if you can really make it.","location":"Zendesk @ Haw Par Techno Centre, 401 Commonwealth Drive, #07-01, Singapore","rsvp_count":65,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Djangonauts/events/240608776/","group_id":19770265,"group_name":"Singapore Djangonauts","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Djangonauts","formatted_time":"28 Jun 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-28T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-28T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.303337,"longitude":103.796524}]}

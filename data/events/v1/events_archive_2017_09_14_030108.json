Over the course of the day, you'll learn about the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform and building applications with Spring Boot, while leveraging Google Cloud Platform for reliability and at-scale data management service integrations. We have an amazing line up of speakers and Cloud Foundry experts from Google and Pivotal, USA. • Casey West, Google - Casey works in internet infrastructure, web app security, and design. All of which have influenced Casey to be a paranoid, UX-oriented, problem-solving internet plumber; his earliest contributions to Perl, live to this day on your Mac. Casey’s speaking and writing ranges from open source communities and culture to technical architecture and automation tips and tricks.  • Cameron Stewart, Pivotal - She has a full-stack developer background thanks to the Galvanize Full Stack Developer program which makes her fiercely passionate about all things cloud-native, 12 factor and agile. • Jeff Johnson, Google - Jeff is a Software Engineer at Google who is giving developers super powers by integrating the tools that run Google with open source Cloud Foundry. He has worked closely with the excellent engineers at Pivotal on the stackdriver-tools BOSH release to integrate Google's Logging, Monitoring, Tracing, and Debugging with Cloud Foundry. Today he is working with Pivotal on bringing Kubernetes' container orchestration strengths to complement Cloud Foundry applications.  For the full agenda, please check out our registration page.

Please RSVP on this link instead of over Meetup (more details below). Title: Hands-On Machine Learning in R - Getting Started Speaker: Graham Williams is the Director of Data Science, Microsoft Asia, Singapore.  Graham joined Microsoft recently after over 30 years as researcher, developer and educator in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Mining, Analytics and Data Science. He was previously lead Data Scientist for the Australian Government's Center of Excellence in Data Analytics, Director of Data Science at the Australian Taxation Office, and Principal Research Scientist with CSIRO Australia. Over those 30 years he has also been an active contributor to the Open Source ecosystem with open source software projects across Emacs, Linux, Data Science, and R. Graham has authored many books, papers, Internet resources and software packages for data scientists. His latest book released in July 2017 introduces the Essentials of Data Science through a programming-by-example based approach to knowledge discovery in R. He maintains an extensive collection of R and Data Science resources on https://togaware.com. Abstract: Machine learning underlies much of today's technological advances driving enterprises who are embracing data and information to become knowledge-driven organisations. R is a popular ecosystem for Knowledge Discovery, Machine Learning and Data Science. It has grown over the past 20 years from a specialist tool for a handful of statisticians to an estimated 4 million users today. It provides a platform for building and deploying machine learning based models.  This tutorial will introduce, with a hands-on focus, the R ecosystem for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. We will understand some of the most widely used machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, and explore how we build models R. The concepts of ensembles will also be introduced as the state-of-the-art classification learner. The tutorial will focus on hands-on learning so that all attendees will gain the experience to then continue with building such models on their own. A particular focus is on the use of readily repeatable template scripts for our tasks. Date/Time Thursday September 14, 2017, beginning with light reception at 6pm Venue MAS Theatrette, Level 16, MAS Building, 10 Shenton Way, Singapore[masked] Preparation Bring your own laptop with your own internet connectivity (or Wireless@SG available on-site) for use of the X2Go application which you should also install. If you have no network connectivity then be sure to install R and Rattle and related packages prior to the session. RSVP on this link, and provide the required info for entry into the venue.  We do not accept RSVP over Meetup.  Due to limited capacity, we will send you a confirmation email if your registration is accepted.  Attendance will be recorded.

They are designed for communication or entertainment: high volumes of data delivered with low latency. IoT devices don’t need to transmit or receive large amounts of data at a time; IoT devices can be anywhere, not just in someone’s living room or office; and many IoT devices will be remote and inaccessible, or without power connections. A new connectivity solution, called Low Power Wide Area Networking, has been developed, pioneered by Actility amongst others, to address specifically the requirements of the internet of things. The most widely adopted LPWA solutions are the open standards of LoRAWAN™ and 3GPP (LTE Cat M1 and Cat NB1). In this session we will listen from Actility's expert team on how they have enabled solutions such as Smart Factories,  Connected FuelTank, Smart Buildings, SupplyChain and many more.

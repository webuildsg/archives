As usual, you can expect there will be 2-3 'long format' talks, with a focus on showing how to implement TensorFlow models from both a theoretical and a practical standpoint.   We've put the MeetUp start time at 6:45pm, so that we can start the talks promptly at 7pm. --- As always, we're actively looking for more speakers - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10). The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor.  It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or an enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

At the end of two hours, you will learn to write simple code in Go, compile it, and execute the program. This lesson is targeted at new beginners who have no prior background in coding, although existing programmers in learning Go are welcomed to join in as well. As spaces are limited, priority goes to new programmers. This is a very basic course, we highly recommend it to anyone who's interested to pick up coding even if you have no prior background at all. Go is easily the future language of choice for big companies! See these articles on why you should learn go here and why it's the future. For this lesson, you must bring along your own computer (any system) and be prepared to learn how to write code and build websites! There are no other prerequisites. Don't have a computer? Pm me and I will bring one more for you. Spaces are limited for only 30 students.","location":"Tri5 Ventures, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #03-26, S139951, Singapore","rsvp_count":30,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code/events/242610079/","group_id":25157730,"group_name":"Singaporeans Learning To Code","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code","formatted_time":"24 Aug 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-24T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-24T13:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.296735,"longitude":103.78669},{"id":"242701151","name":"Elm Chat","description":"UPDATE: hit the wrong date button on first publish - the date will be this Thursday \n\n\n\nAfter a good break in July it is time to get back to doing more with Elm! Come to our first Elm Chat, an evening where we will simply meet at a cafe/bar and chat about Elm and Elm'ish things. Bring your questions about Elm and your ideas about what we should be doing in Elm-Singapore. We have also started planning our next Elm Talks which we will schedule for some time in September. You can follow along and contribute on this github issue.  Don't forget that we also have on-going work to create and choose a logo for the group. You can find the existing contributions here to inspire your own creation. The plan is to kick-off a voting process in September, so submit a pull request with your idea already.

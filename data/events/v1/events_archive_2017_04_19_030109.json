As long as you are taking this course, please join us even if you're just getting started! üë©üèª‚Äçüíª üí™\n\nTo join in this study group, please:\n\n1. Create an account on edX and enroll into the course at this link: https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/info\n\n2. Start from Week 0 or continue where you've left off. As the free wifi we are tapping on at the cafes might sometimes not be that great, do watch the lecture videos before you come. \n\nBring your fully charged laptop and we'll see you soon!\n\nNote: Please buy something at the cafe as we're merely crashing that cafe. We don't want to be kicked out! We're trying out different cafes in search for the most ideal place (spacious, good wifi, convenient location). Until the search is over, do be prepared to tether from your phone when we meet.\n\nPsst! This study group is for women only. :)","location":"The Daily Roundup, 1 Keong Saik Road #01-02, Singapore 089109","rsvp_count":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/252192111920517","group_id":"1684426788471164","group_name":"TechLadies","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/1684426788471164","formatted_time":"19 Apr 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-19T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-19T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.27908,"longitude":103.84139},{"id":"238987624","name":"Continuous Deployment Drupal Hosting with Platform.sh","description":"Hey Drupalers, we rolling out another Drupal meetup for this month.

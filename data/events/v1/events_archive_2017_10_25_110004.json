Now in its 10th edition, the region’s largest downstream-focused conference and exhibition is designed to help refiners, petrochemical operators and chemicals players understand how digital and process technologies can help them achieve overall operational excellence. Digitalisation helps to improve asset integrity, with predictive maintenance, reduce downtime with real-time analytics, improve process efficiency through automated planning and manufacturing and monitor and control energy consumption.  Each year, we issue a call for papers to refiners, EPCs, catalyst companies, technology licensors, additive providers, automation vendors, software vendors and general equipment suppliers and contractors around the globe. We work closely with our Advisory Board, made up of senior refinery and petrochemical professionals from across the region who are tasked with grading the various technical papers received. Only the highest graded, most timely and original papers presented for the first time in the region are selected to be part of the two-day programme. The programme is also packed with thought provoking keynote addresses, high-level panel discussions and in-depth case studies.

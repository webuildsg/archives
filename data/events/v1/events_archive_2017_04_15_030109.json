For these few that make it, they are not run by ordinary entrepreneurs but by entreprisers.\nIn the non-business field, there are some organisations that stand out from the rest. What they do, is effectively different and often times are exemplary. These are run not by leaders/managers/volunteers but by entreprisers. \n\n* NTC reserves the rights to make changes according to circumstances\n\n\n","location":"Singapore Marriott Tang Plaza, 320 Orchard Road, Singapore 238865","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/master-of-science-in-technopreneurship-innovation-info-session-tickets-32176327261?aff=ebapi","group_id":"6023073435","group_name":"Nanyang Technopreneurship Center (NTC), Nanyang Technological University","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/nanyang-technopreneurship-center-ntc-nanyang-technological-university-6023073435","formatted_time":"15 Apr 2017, Sat, 3:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-15T07:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-15T10:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"}]}

First talk - 7.00pm Metrics Driven DevOps: Continuously Delivery High Quality Software. By Myrvin from Dynatrace. Becoming the next Uber is only possible if you deliver what your users want faster than others. Some aspects of DevOps, implementing Continuous Delivery &amp; Feedback Loops and the flexibility that a platform like Cloud Foundry provides are a perfect combination to get closer to that goal. Myrvin is part of a team of Sales Engineers in Dynatrace, ASEAN. He is passionate about how technology shapes human behaviour and has helped many organisations drive the adoption of application performance engineering in Dynatrace. He draws his inspiration from Mozart, Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninoff, and might be spotted conducting a virtual orchestra from time to time. ‚ÄãMyrvin's Linkedin Page‚Äã: https://www.linkedin.com/in/myrvin-yap-04780964/ (https://www.linkedin.com/in/myrvin-yap-04780964/) Second talk - 8.00pm Overview of container platforms from a development perspective.

When git is being used as the number one source control tool in the world, gerrit offers a solid code review platform which also integrates well with Jenkins making it easy to add to the delivery pipeline. This talk is a introduction to how to start using gerrit and integrate it into the build pipeline and covers the following topics. • What is Gerrit?• Setting up Code Reviews for git repos with Gerrit• Bringing in Jenkins for automated Verification• Gerrit Jenkins Trigger Plugin• Demonstration of a Build Pipeline with Gerrit, Jenkins and More \n\n\nTopic 2: Containerized Software Delivery – Jenkins and Docker Docker, along with open container eco system, is changing the way we build, ship and run software. It is also standardizing software delivery. With more and more organizations adopting docker, its essential to understand how the delivery pipeline would look like with Jenkins working along with Dockerfiles, Compose, Swarm etc. This session would demonstrate you the power of Docker along with Jenkins. • Overview of Open Container Eco System• Demo of docker based delivery to production and pre production environments• Dockerfiles, Compose, Swarm \n\n\nAbout the Speaker Gourav ShahFounder, School of Devops, Initcron Systems Being passionate about world of Open Source software, and later managing systems at scale, Gourav has transformed himself to be an expert Devops Enabler.

In the article 'Design for Action' in HBR, Tim Brown and Roger L. Martin talk about how broad the designer's roles have expanded in various places, and how design culture has started to be integrated as part of the processes in many firms. At this meetup, we will invite two intellectuals who have paved their unique way to become a design professional. Agenda:  • Opening / Introduction by Julee • Designing vehicles: an uncharted path beyond Architecture by Colin Choo After his six years of Architectural studies, Colin was expected to get a job with his Master of Architecture.  He was expected to be drawing buildings. Except that Colin did the unexpected - he advanced right up to the final stage of Architecture before diverting from the expected path. He is now designing vehicles at HOPE Technik, where he penned the design of four versions of the Tumbler Element (also known as the ‘Red Rhino’ fire truck in Singapore) and many others. Find out why he thinks that even though he had pulled the plug on Architecture, Architecture was in fact what led him to become a vehicle designer today. • My Journey from Sociology into Business Ecosystems by Nazish Zafar Sociologists &amp; anthropologists examine how our lives are shaped by society, and their research is often focused on uncovering these 'invisible' structures of influence.  Nazish will share some of the interesting projects she has done around the world, such as the study of orphanages in Russia, public health education in Brazil, interviewing families in high poverty neighbourhoods in Baltimore and, most recently, examining the small business and start-up economy in Singapore.  With a decade of academic research in Sociology, she shows us how she is applying her skills to the sphere of design thinking, with practical takeaways for everyone. • Q &amp; A with speakers ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- Speaker's Bio:  Colin Choo Colin holds the role of Artistic Manager at HOPE Technik where he determines design directions for the company’s various products ranging from emergency response vehicles to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). His involvement with HOPE Technik’s projects began in 2008 when he collaborated to design the first generation of the Tumbler Element – the vehicle that became the company’s flagship firefighting vehicle supporting Singapore’s fire department services. Since then, Colin has gone on to serve as lead product designer for the subsequent three generations of the Tumbler Element as well as for all of HOPE Technik’s emergency response vehicles.  Before his tenure at HOPE Technik, Colin spent several years honing his skills in architecture design after graduating from the National University of Singapore with a Master of Architecture, where he was placed on Dean’s list twice and awarded the Ramalingam Gold Medal for distinguished academic performance.  While working on various mixed-use, residential and industrial projects in Singapore and China, he actively pursued his interest in vehicle design. His design, the ‘Peugeot Blade’, was shortlisted as one of the top 25 finalists of the prestigious International Peugeot design competition in 2008. He was also the only Singapore representative shortlisted in the competition.  Nazish Zafar Nazish Zafar is a sociologist who completed her PhD at Johns Hopkins University. Her research was about the survival and growth of small businesses, and she explored the role of the government in the small business economy.  During her research, Nazish launched a series of photographic essays online called Shopkeeper Stories featuring interviews with business owners from a wide variety of trades (including florists, tech entrepreneurs, lawyers, and more). In 2015, she published a coffeetable book, and continues to publish photographic essays on her blog. Nazish specialises in qualitative research and has done a wide range of projects in Brazil, Russia, the United States, and Singapore.","location":"Palo IT, 26A, Circular Road, 049382, Singapore","rsvp_count":83,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Design-Bootcamp-Asia/events/241741348/","group_id":19617994,"group_name":"Design Bootcamp Asia","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Design-Bootcamp-Asia","formatted_time":"25 Jul 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-25T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-25T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.287033,"longitude":103.848953}]}

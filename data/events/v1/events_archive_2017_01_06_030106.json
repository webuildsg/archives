He got his B.E. degree from University of Science and Technology, China in 2007 and Ph.D. degree from National University of Singapore in 2014. He was a postdoc researcher at University of California, Berkeley from 2014 to 2015. His current research interest focus is on machine learning and computer vision techniques for large-scale data analysis. Specifically, he has done work in object recognition, deep learning, machine learning, high-dimensional statistics and big data analysis. Prof Feng will introduce the deep learning approaches developed by his group for solving several fundamental computer vision research problems as well as their applications in practice. He will concentrate on presenting solutions to several practical issues in these applications in order to let computers understand the visual world more intelligently, such as how to achieve robustness to various noisy signals, how to integrate contextual information effectively and how to build a network to learn in an endless way. Towards solving these issues, he will also introduce three types of new deep neural network models in detail - recurrent attentive neural networks, multi-path feedback networks, and self-learning networks. Finally, he will conclude by introducing some trends and problems in modern computer vision research.","location":"SGInnovate, 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":139,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup/events/236062916/","group_id":21292690,"group_name":"Singapore Self-driving Car Engineering Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup","formatted_time":"06 Jan 2017, Fri, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2017-01-06T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-01-06T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.288118,"longitude":103.847542},{"id":"qndnvlywcbjb","name":"Let's meet to share about improvised lab equipment and home experiments","description":"This commences a series of regular meet-ups, tentatively scheduled for the first Friday evening of the month.

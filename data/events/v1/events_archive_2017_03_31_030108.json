Moss speaks frequently before a wide range of audiences on the topic of computer and information security. In 2009 Moss was appointed to the Homeland Security Advisory Council to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary on matters related to homeland security. Moss is uniquely qualified with his ability to bridge the gap between the underground researcher community and law enforcement, between the worlds of pure research and responsible application disclosure.\n\nHALVAR FLAKE\nThomas Dullien / Halvar Flake started work in reverse engineering and digital rights management in the mid-90s, and began to apply reverse engineering to vulnerability research shortly thereafter. He pioneered early windows heap exploitation, patch diffing / bindiffing and various other reverse engineering techniques. In 2004, he started zynamics, a company focused on reverse engineering technologies. He continued to publish about reverse engineering, ROP gadget search, and knowledge management technologies in relation to reverse engineering. In 2011, zynamics was acquired by Google, and Halvar spent the next few years working on defensive technologies that leveraged the then hot buzzwords \"big data\" and \"machine learning\". In summer 2015, Halvar received the lifetime achievement Pwnie, and decided to take a year off to travel, read, and surf. Since November 2016, he is back at Google.\n\nSponsor:\nThis event is kindly sponsored by NUS Enterprise.","location":"i3 Auditorium, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Icube Building, Singapore 119613, ","rsvp_count":38,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1802311516756267","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"31 Mar 2017, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-31T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-31T12:45:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"1471421542931660","name":"Future Fridays: How Can We Make Better Decisions?","description":"Future Fridays Series 1: 31 March - 26 May\n\nWhat if you can make sense of all the data, understand common biases in thinking and make more informed decisions for our country?

We'll also do a bit of 'show-of-hands' just to understand what people are interested in seeing and/or presenting.  Because this is a \"TensorFlow Summit\" related event, Google has generously offered to sponsor some food - so expect pizza (unless there are compelling suggestions in the comments below).","location":"Google Asia Pacific, 70 Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City, , Singapore","rsvp_count":249,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/237032130/","group_id":21982556,"group_name":"TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore","formatted_time":"16 Feb 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-02-16T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-02-16T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"},{"id":"236725569","name":"Gophers Meetup #19 - Feb 2016","description":"Let's celebrate Go 1.8 release party!

Nix and its related technologies bring a radically different approach to server/container management and allows you to provision OS and software in repeatable and consistent ways. The inaugural session will be focused on bringing up a NixOS environment and a workshop covering the various parts of the ecosystem but we will also be covering actual use cases and how to deal with common pain-points in a Nix context.

In this talk, we’ll discuss how things were traditionally done in Android, problematic areas with these approaches, and how RxJava can help solve some of these issues.

We needed to transform the architecture to bring this new feature to life, but the tunnel effect was putting at risk the whole delivery timeline. The target was a public media event, no chance to change the date. The Product Owner, an amazing person, trusted us, but he was freaking out. And we did too, actually. Eager to find a more progressive transformation of our architecture, we were unable to find a step by step approach that didn’t involve books and weeks of learning. We came to create our own workshop to design it. It was very casually thought, but it worked magic. A breakthrough. It made me completely change the way I'm coaching agile team when facing any architecture problem.\nIn this meetup I'd like not only to share this workshop but to help you experiment it on your real life cases. Coz we're coders, right? We don't talk. We practice. We test. So join us, bring your refactoring problems, and lets put them to the grill.","location":"Paypal Singapore, 5 Temasek Blvd, #07-01, Suntec Tower 5, Singapore 038985","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/being-agile-incremental-refactoring-tickets-33948554039?aff=ebapi","group_id":"12820375799","group_name":"TechTalks","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/techtalks-12820375799","formatted_time":"04 May 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-05-04T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-05-04T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"307471516351038","name":"DIY Light Saber workshop","description":"https://diylightsaber.eventbrite.sg\n\nMay the 4th be with you! \nMake your own DIY lightsaber using everyday materials and at the same time explore the different types of LEDs, drawing circuits & soldering.

Together, we discuss how they’ve been impacted by the rise of tech, ways they’ve adapted and innovated along the way, and what they expect to see in the future.\n\nIn June we are exploring the InsurTech space in Singapore and how key industry players are responding to disruptive forces.\n\nWhat You’ll Take Away: Gain insight and inspiration from experts working in the insurance industry in Singapore and hear first-hand how technology is transforming their work and affecting yours. Expand your understanding of today’s tech-based world, and fuel your own ideas for the future.\n\nWhy It Matters: The omnipresence of technology has rapidly transformed lives over the last decade (remember, the iPhone was only released in 2007). Now, it’s rare to go about a regular day without interacting with tech — whether it’s an alarm app that wakes you up, your Nest Thermostat-regulated apartment, or the software you use at work. Staying ahead of the innovation curve and being able to predict the future of tech in various industries has never been more important — both at work and at play.\n\nThis event is co-presented with AXA Singapore and NTUC U Startup.","location":"NTUC Room 701, , Singapore","rsvp_count":5,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/118199368766004","group_id":711704195596196,"group_name":"General Assembly Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/711704195596196","formatted_time":"30 Jun 2017, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-30T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-30T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"}]}

For those who have never used TypeScript, this meetup would be a great opportunity for you to learn the ins and outs of using it in production.\n\nMore about Typescript: http://www.typescriptlang.org/\n\n\nTopic:\nTypeScript and Redux with React Native\n\n\nAgenda\n7.00-7.30pm: Networking, Meet and Greet\n7.30-8.00pm: Sharing by Speakers (Lightning Talks)\n8.00-8.30pm: Q&A and Sharing from the Floor\n8.30-9pm: Networking, Wine and Cheese\n\nWho Should Attend?\n- Anyone interested in TypeScript\n- Anyone moving from JavaScript to TypeScript\n- People using Typescript in their work currently\n\nOur Speakers:\n1.

We build a public, permissioned chain for small-and-medium enterprise (SME) buyers and suppliers to create supply chain optimization tools and gain access to affordable capital sources to grow their businesses. Our smart contract-based ecosystem allows SMEs to quickly implement customized SCF solutions or issue digital tokens on a permissioned fork of Ethereum supporting data privacy. We adopt a consensus protocol and quadratic voting based governance model to provide practical, finite time security guarantees on our public, permissioned blockchainhybrid. From financing to procure-to-pay, our products utilize smart contracts to optimize the global supply chain for buyers, suppliers, and financiers.

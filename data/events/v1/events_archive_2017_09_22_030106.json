We are back with another session of Friday Hacks! This week we have Dmitry from PayPal who will be talking about Functional Programming and Herbert from NUS Hackers who will be talking about solving complex problems using SQL!\n\nDate/Time: Friday, September 22 at 6:30pm \nVenue: SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS \nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\n\nTalk 1: An Introduction to Functional Programming with Scala\n\nTalk Description\nThis talk will cover basic material about Functional programming with an example of Scala. The baseline of this talk is built on the concept of learning a new programming language through 3 aspects: Primitives, Means of Combination and Means of Abstraction. I am also going to share my personal experience of using Scala in big enterprises and provide some examples and interesting cases. The main purpose of this talk is to acquaint the audience with some fundamental principles of functional programming, to try to rethink core problems of software engineering and to consider advantages and disadvantages of such engineering approaches. We will also talk about areas where functional programming already plays a dominant role for innovation: data streams, parallel data processing, etc.\n\nSpeaker Profile\nDmitry Martyanov, Senior Software Engineer in PayPal Singapore, Risk team. Dmitry has over 5 years of professional experience with Scala in different domains like API services, Data processing, and Distributed Systems. Before moving to Singapore, he was an enterprise data services architect in one of the biggest Consumer Digital Banks in the world based in Moscow where Scala was primary language for all middle-tier services.\n\n\nTalk 2: SQL Queries Wizardry\n\nTalk Description\nSQL is the most common language used to interact with databases nowadays. However, due to its declarative nature, many developers do not realise what goes on under the hood. When faced with more complex problems, developers often turn to ORMs (object-relational mapping) which does not require them to interact with SQL directly. Through this talk, I will show some of the more advanced SQL techniques, and how they can be used to solve complex problems we may face.\n\nSpeaker Profile\nHerbert is a NUS Hackers coreteam member and a Year 3 Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduate. He interned as a data scientist at Twitter Singapore last summer, running SQL queries every day.\n\n\nSupported by: The HANGAR by NUS Enterprise — the campus hub for entrepreneurs.","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS, , Singapore","rsvp_count":16,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/118701905463190","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"22 Sep 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-09-22T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-22T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"783715495142343","name":"TGIFHacks #69 - Telegram Bots: Create Your Own Chatbot","description":"In this workshop, we will learn the very basics of creating a Telegram Bot using Python. We will be covering how to create one from scratch, from the basics such as handling chat events and creating custom keyboards to more advanced topics like how to scrape data from other websites and dealing with data storage for your bot. If that’s not enough, we will also be walking you guys through how to make your bot asynchronous and how to get it hosted on Heroku. \n\nAll you need for this workshop is a laptop, a text editor (like Sublime Text, Atom or Notepad++), Python 3 and Telegram Desktop (with a registered account). To get the most out of this workshop, we recommend all attendees to have basic knowledge on Python syntax.\n\nSpeaker: Clarence Castillo & Steve Ye\nPrerequisites: Basic Python syntax\nWhat to install?: Text Editor (Sublime, Atom), Python 3.6.x","location":"LT 4, North Spine, , Singapore","rsvp_count":118,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/783715495142343","group_id":"219467331408976","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"22 Sep 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-09-22T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-22T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"}]}

BigQuery’s serverless architecture continues to redefine what it means to be fully managed. It scales seamlessly, analyzes terabytes of data in seconds and supports concurrent data queries for large organizations, without requiring capacity provisioning or systems tuning. As always, BigQuery is highly available, and encrypts all data at rest. Learn how to migrate, transform, and monitor your data into GCP with Big Query and Dataflow. This talk will cover the steps involved for moving your data warehouse, considerations, and provide an approach for project success. We will also dive into Python code for some hands on demonstrations. Time : 7pm to 9pm (please be punctual, will start on time ;)) Speaker : Andrew Stevens Our volunteer speaker for this session is Andrew Stevens. He has brought Dataflow and Big Query to many production systems .

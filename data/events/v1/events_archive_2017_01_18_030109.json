How does a solver perform automated reasoning? And how do they fit into the usual bag of tools (such as disassemblers and fuzzers) used by the security community? In this talk, I will explain how everything fits in, and walk through the various ways to apply solvers to analyze software to find security bugs, through both static and dynamic analysis. Then, I will talk about the latest exciting developments, and some of the cutting-edge research that we and our collaborators are working on. I will end with a demo, and walk through some open-source tools that security folks can readily play with to get started.\n\nFree pizza will be served before the talk at around 6:30pm!

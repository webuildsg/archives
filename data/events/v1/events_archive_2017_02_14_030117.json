Ever since the first continuity cut was used in 1898 by Rober W. Paul, there has been a development of rules in film montage in which film makers “abide by” such as the 180 degree rule and match action cuts. Speaker Lynus Hee has recently been concluded a year-long research into this area of 360 VR video editing and will share his findings.

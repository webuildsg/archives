Selva is a Consultant for Virtualization Projects working with Optimum solutions for SMBC - Horizon View implementation project assignment. He's been working in Infrastructure Implement and support for over 15 years across India, USA and Singapore. He is interested in Powershell and PowerCLi which simplifies the implementation / Configurations with no manual errors. Also, he has developed his own GUI tools for various activities to simplify admin jobs which includes vSphere Build, Horizon View configuration, View pool Setup, View Pool reports etc.. He always suggests if you repeat, automate it. This Technical discussion focuses on 1.  How to incorporate vSphere PowerCLI with daily operations, Implementation and Reports. 2.   The discussion on various Infrastructure implementation / configuration scenarios and how PowerCLI used as the solution. 3.  Complete demonstration of vCenter server Configuration using PowerCLI. (Add host, Create virtual switch etc) 4.  Latest updates of PowerCLI. There is possible we will have another session, will update soon. Hope to see you all.","location":"Microsoft Singapore, One Marina Boulevard, Level 22, Meeting Room","rsvp_count":40,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/mssgug/events/235534105/","group_id":18429776,"group_name":"Microsoft User Groups (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/mssgug","formatted_time":"10 Dec 2016, Sat, 9:00 am","start_time":"2016-12-10T01:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-12-10T03:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"},{"id":"181275315670961","name":"Elves Workshop by FabCafe","description":"Elves Workshop by FabCafe\nSaturday-Sunday, 10 -11 December 2016\n10am-7pm ( last entry at 6pm)\nLevel 4 galleries \nFree.

However, many organisations continue to struggle with large, monolithic frontend codebases. In this talk, we'll explore how micro frontends can help make your code cleaner, your teams more autonomous, and enable incremental upgrades to your tech stack. By exploring real-world examples, you'll gain an understanding of when this architectural style can be helpful, and how to begin using it in your own projects.","location":"ThoughtWorks , 18 cross street #11-08 China Sq Central (S)048423, Singapore","rsvp_count":190,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Talks-Tech/events/249111916/","group_id":22580320,"group_name":"ThoughtWorks Talks Tech","group_url":"http://meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Talks-Tech","formatted_time":"11 Apr 2018, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-04-11T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-04-11T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.283653,"longitude":103.846992},{"id":"248992937","name":"CryptoCurrency Wallets","description":"Ticket : https://www.eventbrite.com/e/cryptocurrency-wallets-tickets-45019169548 • What we'll do Timeline:Timeline:18:00~18:30 : Registration18:30~18:40 : Introduction18:40 - 19:10 : Bitcoin Wallet19:10 - 20:40 : Simple Bitcoin Website20:40 : Networking Speaker :Sun Sagong (Co-Founder of Blockchain &amp;Dapps meetup &amp; blockchain developer)Topic : Bitcoin Wallet Kenneth Hu (Founder of Blockchain &amp;Dapps meetup &amp; blockchain developer)Topic : Simple Bitcoin Website with NodeJS https://github.com/EtherSingapore/talks/issues • What to bring • Important to know","location":"22CF12, Level 22, Microsoft Singapore, Singapore 018989, One Marina Boulevard","rsvp_count":81,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/BlockChain-Dapps-Technology/events/248992937/","group_id":25122899,"group_name":"BlockChain & Dapps Technology","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BlockChain-Dapps-Technology","formatted_time":"11 Apr 2018, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-04-11T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-04-11T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.282387,"longitude":103.85244},{"id":"44870505891","name":"FREE Data Science Info Session [NO PROGRAMMING BACKGROUND REQUIRED]","description":"Have a background in coding but wish to learn more?

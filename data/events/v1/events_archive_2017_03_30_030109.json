Patenting activity also increased significantly: The number of annual international patent applications involving ASEAN-based inventors has tripled from the early 2000s to the early 2010s.  \nA research team of the EU-funded SEA-EU-NET project carried out a study assessing the research output in ASEAN Member States in the period 2000 to 2014. The lead author of the study, Alexander Degelsegger, Centre for Social Innovation, Austria will present the key findings and identify the public policy measures behind them.               \nThis seminar will be of interest to anyone interested in a comparative analysis of scientific output and patenting activities of the ten ASEAN countries and the role of international collaboration therein. \nThis event is kindly supported by the National Research Foundation of Singapore.

Many of today’s tools, technologies, and business models will soon cease to exist, only to be replaced by newer ones. Architects face the challenge of planning for today’s systems knowing that the problems of tomorrow will be completely different from the problems of today. Evolutionary architecture is an architectural approach that prioritizes change as a first principle but balances this need with delivering value early. Architects who adopt evolutionary architecture approaches make better choices that enable future change. Patrick Kua explains what evolutionary architecture is and why it’s important. Patrick examines some well-known architectural styles, looking at how well they adapt to change and fit the characteristics of evolutionary architecture, before outlining the principles that guide architectural and design decisions and concrete practices to help teams build systems that can evolve over time.

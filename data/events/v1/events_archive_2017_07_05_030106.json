We have seen this over many years across a range of applications in critical infrastructure, communications and more recently in medical devices. This talk will examine some of the attacks and vulnerabilities that have already been observed, look at some of the parallels with other technologies, and discuss the issue of why we keep repeating the same mistakes.\nBioAndrew is currently the Dean of the School of Science at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, and was previously Head of the School of Computer and Security Science at the same institution. He has been an active teacher and researcher in cyber security for nearly two decades, and has a wealth of experience in network security, computer security, computer forensics, critical infrastructure protection, control systems security, information security and risk management. Andrew has consulted to industry by performing cyber security vulnerability assessments on critical infrastructure installations across Australia, including power, water and gas utilities. Andrew is regularly invited to give public lectures on cyber security topics, and was appointed to the Interpol Global Cybercrime Expert Group in 2015.\nSpeaker: Professor Craig ValliTitle: Director, ECU Security Research InstituteCompany: Edith Cowan UniversityTopic: Wannacry and other malware. Lessons learned (and not learned).\nSynopsisAs well as the recent Wannacry ransomware attack, there are ongoing, daily instances of malware being used by cyber criminals against small, medium and large organisations. There was nothing particularly new about the Wannacry attack, so why did it cause so much disruption, and generate so much publicity? This talk will examine the attack, the attackers, and what we need to do to protect ourselves from such attacks in the future.\nBioProfessor Craig Valli has over 30 year’s experience in the ICT Industry and consults to industry and government on cyber security and digital forensics matters. Along with being Director of the Edith Cowan University Security Research Institute, he is a Professor of Digital Forensics, a Fellow of the Australian Computer Society and Director of the Australian Computer Society Centre of Expertise in Security at ECU. He also currently holds the position of research director for the Australian Cyber Security Research Institute. Craig is the current President of the High Tech Crime Investigators Association (Australian Chapter) and a Member of the INTERPOL Cyber Crime Experts Group.","location":"PSB Academy City Campus, Marina Square, Singapore 039594","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/cybersecurity-guest-lectures-by-prof-andrew-woodward-and-prof-craig-valli-tickets-35834186015?aff=ebapi","group_id":"14459958094","group_name":"IET PSB Academy On Campus","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/iet-psb-academy-on-campus-14459958094","formatted_time":"05 Jul 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-05T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-05T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"240930589","name":"Practical Cats","description":"Heard of Cats?

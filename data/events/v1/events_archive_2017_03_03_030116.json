This year, OneMaker Group is proud to bring together makers and partners for a full week long of workshops for Singapore Design Week! We've brought in some of the favourites from SDW 2016 and new stuff that even we didn't know about. Have fun exploring the workshops that we have prepared and don't be shy! Come join us.

We will be exploring cool hardware at our next Friday Hacks! Ever wondered what goes into building a laser cutter machine? Machine builder Kiwi will be doing a reverse teardown of a CO2 laser cutter! A team from Ionic3DP will also be sharing about their experiences in building their own 3D printers! You can look forward to live demos (:\n\nDate/Time: Friday, March 3rd at 6:30pm\nVenue: The Hangar by NUS Enterprise\nFree pizza is served before the talks!\n\nTalk 1: An Introduction to DIY Laser Cutters\n\nTalk Description:\n\nLaser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser through optics and CNC (computer numerical control).\n\nCommon uses are cutting and engraving patterns onto materials such as wood, leather and acrylic, and is considered one of the faster processes in rapid prototyping. Join us for this sharing session to demystify the laser cutter machine!\n\nSpeaker Profile:\n\nKee Wee Teng is an innovative machine designer and builder, and has worked on a multitude of fabrication machines, including CNCs, 3D Printers, vacuum formers and laser cutters. Dismayed by the slow decline of manufacturing capabilities in Singapore, he set out to set an example by building a machine in 6 months with limited resources and knowledge, able to do additive, subtractive, forming and cutting manufacturing, and showcased it at Makerfaire 2016. He hopes to inspire and encourage others in Singapore to adopt the same innovative Maker spirit that built early Singapore! Kiwi was also recently featured in Challenge Magazine: https://www.challenge.gov.sg/print/feature/taking-things-into-their-own-hands.\n\nTalk 2: The Kappa 3D Printer\n\nTalk Description:\n\nIonic3DP will be presenting their new 3D printer design which is based on Scott Russell Kinematics. Briefly talking about the existing products in the market and their limitations. An overview of the technology used in our design, it’s features and advantages. Finishing with how we began the project and our goal towards the future. \n\nSpeakers' Profiles:\n\nFrancis Regan graduated from School of Computing NUS and has been working in the 3D printer industry for more than 7 years. Xinxin Du finished his PhD from ECE NUS recently and he is heavily involved in the projects related to automation and control. Shabbir received his MBA from Cardiff Business School, United Kingdom. His experience is more towards business and was with Techgrand to provide mentor supports to startups.\n\nOur Sponsors:\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by NUS Enterprise.","location":"The Hangar by NUS Enterprise, 21 Heng Mui Keng Terrace, Singapore 119613","rsvp_count":13,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/139093879943292","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"03 Mar 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-03-03T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-03T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2920833826065,"longitude":103.77563476562},{"id":"qndnvlywfbfb","name":"Let's meet to share about improvised lab equipment and home experiments","description":"This commences a series of regular meet-ups, tentatively scheduled for the first Friday evening of the month.

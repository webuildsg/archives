Now you're ready to ace that big presentation, right?\n\nWhile a bit of magical thinking can help us to add ritual and order to our everyday lives, mistaking correlation (wearing red socks) for causation (acing the presentation) can have serious consequences when we use that to make big decisions. Join us this Friday as we explore some common instances where we make decisions this way, and how we might be able to be more conscientious about seeing patterns which may or may not be there. \n\n(and the first person who can explain why this week's photo is a shark gets a pair of lucky socks!)\n\nJoin community leaders, educators, entrepreneurs and other active citizens like yourself to design a product that can help others access facts, start conversations and make better decisions. Over the course of 8 weeks, we will deep dive into:\n-How decisions are made\n-Common bias in thinking and decision-making\n-Sensemaking and storytelling with data\n\nAt the end of the series, the product we design will be exhibited in 2 HDB locations so we can share our insights.\n\nIf you care about civic education and the future of Singapore, start taking action today!\n\nPlease note that you will be signing up a series and not for individual sessions because the sessions are cumulative. We will be taking a break on 14 April for the Good Friday public holiday. The specific dates we will be running for are:\n-31 March\n-7 April\n-21 April\n-28 April\n-5 May\n-12 May\n-19 May\n-26 May\n\nSee you soon!","location":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2), 1 Tampines Street 73, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":3,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/424353447917487","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"28 Apr 2017, Fri, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2017-04-28T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-28T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.35782,"longitude":103.93187}]}

Fund Yourself Now improves on traditional crowdfunding sites by allowing more control once funds are distributed; providing support/mentors, and lowering transaction costs About the speaker: Kenneth is the co-founder of FundYourselfNow. FundYourselfNow vision is to build a global crypto-currency crowdfunding and talent marketplace that is safer, cheaper and faster than existing platforms.  Kenneth has over 10 years of experience in tech, starting his tech career in Accenture, and starting his software development company 4 years ago, before founding FundYourselfNow. www.fundyourselfnow.com  Topics: Crowdfunding has been around for centuries. We are currently at the nexus of a pivotal moment. The Internet has decentralised and democratised information flow. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are set to decentralise and democratise the flow of value In this session, we will explore how we are implementing blockchain technologies to improve crowdfunding by ensuring greater accountability by project creators, protection backers from fraud &amp; helpers to support the project that they love.

This is possible because infrastructure has become abstracted from physical hardware, meaning it can be treated like a software system. Version control systems, Test-Driven Development (TDD), Continuous Integration (CI), and Continuous Delivery (CD) can now be applied to the realm of infrastructure. The talk walks through a number of patterns for implementing IaC tools such as AWS, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, and Terraform, to build a change management pipeline to automatically test and apply configuration to infrastructure. The patterns are not tool-specific, so should be useful for any team using these types of tools. About Kief:Kief is Principal Cloud Technologist with ThoughtWorks and author of Infrastructure as Code, published by O'Reilly.Kief enjoys helping organisations adopt cloud age technologies and practices. This usually involves buzzwords like cloud, digital platforms, infrastructure automation, DevOps, and Continuous Delivery.Originally from Tennessee, Kief has been been building teams to deliver software as a service in London since the dotcom days.","location":"ThoughtWorks , 18 cross street #11-08 China Sq Central (S)048423, Singapore","rsvp_count":157,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Talks-Tech/events/244072204/","group_id":22580320,"group_name":"ThoughtWorks Talks Tech","group_url":"http://meetup.com/ThoughtWorks-Talks-Tech","formatted_time":"24 Oct 2017, Tue, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2017-10-24T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-10-24T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.283653,"longitude":103.846992},{"id":"243844018","name":"SharePoint Community - Microsoft Ignite Conference Recap","description":"In this session, we will summarize all of the great new announcements of the recent Microsoft Ignite conference for SharePoint and Office 365.

During the talk, Joel will touch on the following topics:  • His experience coming into the data science realm (struggled with technical, had to learn on his own)• His experience working with Python and trying to “learn how to programme”. Deadend.• His experience with R, in particular the Tidyverse• What his company has been doing internally to build a community of R users/Github• Challenges that he sees for businesses moving from Excel analytics to Open Source R/Python/Github and collaborative analytics. Speaker Bio: Joel Campbell is a Senior Manager in Data Insights &amp; Intelligence at Rio Tinto. His responsibilities include leading projects that deliver value to the business by extracting insights and intelligence from data. Joel is currently based in Brisbane, QLD Australia. Joel has worked at Rio Tinto for the past eleven years in a variety of global service delivery and project organisations. Prior to Australia, Joel was based in Salt Lake City, UT. He has managed projects at most Rio Tinto locations. Joel’s background is diverse and he is a newcomer to data science. His education is in Political Science, Psychology, and Business and his work experience in Shared Services. Due to an acute interest, in early 2016 Joel joined a team within Rio Tinto that was piloting some of the concepts. He was new to SQL, AWS, R, Python, and the other tools of data science. He has spent the past two years “learning on the job” and collaborating with others in the data science community to increase his knowledge. His perspective is helpful as it demonstrates the journey that others will need to take as they join the ranks of data science professionals. Joel’s hobbies include learning, reading, bbq, and spending time with his family.

Now in its 10th edition, the region’s largest downstream-focused conference and exhibition is designed to help refiners, petrochemical operators and chemicals players understand how digital and process technologies can help them achieve overall operational excellence. Digitalisation helps to improve asset integrity, with predictive maintenance, reduce downtime with real-time analytics, improve process efficiency through automated planning and manufacturing and monitor and control energy consumption.  Each year, we issue a call for papers to refiners, EPCs, catalyst companies, technology licensors, additive providers, automation vendors, software vendors and general equipment suppliers and contractors around the globe. We work closely with our Advisory Board, made up of senior refinery and petrochemical professionals from across the region who are tasked with grading the various technical papers received. Only the highest graded, most timely and original papers presented for the first time in the region are selected to be part of the two-day programme. The programme is also packed with thought provoking keynote addresses, high-level panel discussions and in-depth case studies.

Some highlights of the conference this year • International Keynote speakers to learn from the best in the industry • Multiple workshops to get hands on experience from practitioners in the field • A whole week of DevOps and PowerShell Automation! That's right! In the spirit of Collaboration and Openness, DevOpsDays Singapore and PowerShell Conference Asia will be together this year. That's great! But what does this mean? Have your events merged? No, both events are still organised independently and you can choose to attend one or both. However, for convenience both events are scheduled for the same week and will be hosted at the same venue back to back plus we offer generous discount codes on the tickets for those who want to attend both events. So if you had a difficult choice last year on which one to attend, this might make it a lot easier this year. Why are you doing this? We would like to bring two groups with a common interest together. Simple as that, we truly believe in networking, personal growth and that learning something new is more fun together. We bring you the convenience of two great conferences in a single week at one location - convenient if you're travelling! Why should DevOps practitioners attend Powershell Conference Asia? PowerShell is becoming an additional tool for DevOps operations, especially useful on the Microsoft stack but also across Clouds and Platforms. PowerShell features in the management of Azure, AWS and Google Cloud, it is open source and is being adopted on Linux and Mac as well as Windows. Folks already working in DevOps roles and teams who may not be introduced to PowerShell yet have the opportunity to explore at the PowerShell Conference. Why should PowerShell professionals attend DevOpsDays Singapore? PowerShell professionals find themselves moving more into a DevOps way of working; they have the opportunity to connect with these communities and be introduced to technologies that are easier for them to access with skills they've already learned. What is the agenda format? We are finalising the program currently, but we expect to run the events as follows: Wed October 25 9AM-5PM DevOpsDays talks, open spaces &amp; after partyThu October 26 9AM-1PM DevOpsDays workshopsThu October 26 1PM-5PM PowerShell Conference WorkshopsFri October 27 1PM-5PM PSConf talks &amp; after partySat October 28 1PM-5PM PSConf talks How about ticketing? How will that work? We are finalising the exact details but it will work like this: • Tickets are sold separately for each event. •  When you purchase a ticket for DevOpsDays Singapore or PowerShell Conference Asia, you will receive a personalised discount code for the other event. • You can use this discount code to purchase your second ticket; the discount code is not transferable. • You will get Event Badges for each event that will give you access to the events you paid for including any workshops I am a speaker, can I submit to both conferences? Sure! We absolutely encourage that. The inks to the submission forms will be posted here as soon as possible so please check back. Both events will review the submissions independently so we cannot promise what your paper will be selected, but we absolutely welcome your submissions. We are accepting talk submissions till Monday, Sep 11, 2017! Submit your talk now  Do you refund Travel &amp; Expenses for selected speakers? Many open source developers, however, cannot get funding from their employers or pay for their own travel to attend these conferences. Conference committee will look on a case by case submission if we cover the Travel &amp; Expenses. We will update the terms in our Call for Papers form. Where do I find more information?

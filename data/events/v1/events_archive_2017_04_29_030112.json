Go to this website and register: https://pages.chef.io/ChefMeetup_Singapore_RSVP.html WHAT IS HABITAT? Habitat is Chef’s open-source project for application automation.  It simplifies container management by packaging applications in a compact, atomic, and easily auditable format that makes it easier to deploy your application on various container runtimes.  It also helps you run stateful application services (think Redis, Mongo, etc) on cloud instances, VMs, or bare metal. Find out more at habitat.sh. WHO SHOULD ATTEND? You are an early adopter. You want to use leading edge technology and embark with Chef on the journey to invent the new way of managing and deploying applications? Then this hands on day is for you. This will be a hands-on workshop aimed at anyone involved in building, deploying, or managing applications.  You may be a developer or may come from an infrastructure background. You may currently be working with container technology or a microservices architecture (or planning to).   Habitat helps simplify the processes required to build, deploy, and manage your applications and, if you’re already using containers, even makes containers more awesome.","location":"Microsoft Operations Pte Ltd. | Floor 22, #22-01 One Marina Boulevard | Singapore 018989","rsvp_count":1,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/devops-singapore/events/238436303/","group_id":3202252,"group_name":"DevOps Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/devops-singapore","formatted_time":"29 Apr 2017, Sat, 8:00 am","start_time":"2017-04-29T00:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-29T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.282387,"longitude":103.85244},{"id":"1182219985238877","name":"TechLadies Go to UNited We Hack!","description":"TechLadies is a community partner for UNited We Hack.

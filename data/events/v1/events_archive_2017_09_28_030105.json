This talk will introduce both the concept of open and closed innovation and illustrate, through case studies from companies such as Lego and Starbucks, how open innovation has helped a number of the world’s leading companies to stay ahead of their competitors. Open innovation is not only restricted to activities between companies and the speaker will show how we can or may have already unwittingly get involved in the process.\r\n \r\n \r\n* NTC reserves the rights to make changes according to circumstances","location":"Marriott, 320 Orchard Road, Singapore 238865","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/master-of-science-in-technopreneurship-innovation-information-session-tickets-37833548161?aff=ebapi","group_id":"6023073435","group_name":"Nanyang Technopreneurship Center (NTC), Nanyang Technological University","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/nanyang-technopreneurship-center-ntc-nanyang-technological-university-6023073435","formatted_time":"28 Sep 2017, Thu, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-09-28T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-28T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"243319189","name":"GTT0928: User Trust - Fighting the Shadows: An Insider’s tale","description":"Fighting the Shadows: An Insider’s tale User Trust, Safety and Identity protection are classic adversarial learning challenges: As soon as an automated system successfully learns how to stop one scheme, fraudsters mutate and change their attack patterns. Against intelligent adversaries in a fluid problem space, the Trust and Safety team at Grab operates with the mandate of keeping the ecosystem safe and fair for all our users, passengers and drivers alike. The rapidly evolving fraud trends of the world constantly requires new approaches to age-old problems. Thus, this session will describe our machine learning techniques in providing a safety score and detecting incentive fraud to help Grab stay informed and secure in the complex two-sided marketplace that powers the ride hailing ecosystem. The speakers will share their experiences, data driven case-studies and the unique lessons they learned from combining theoretical expertise, technology and human intuition to the spectrum of good, bad and grey that is the world of user trust, identity and safety. Overall, this talk will benefit anyone interested in adversarial learning, human psychology and game theory. \" \n\n\nPlease RSVP here.

Topics include: • Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). • Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). • Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).  The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. This course runs for 11 Weeks – ends in December and requires between 5 and 10 hours of time per week. The course can be taken for free, or for a small fee to Coursera you can have your assignments graded and receive a certificate at the end. Singaporeans are able to claim the course fees with http://www.skillsfuture.sg/. We will be meeting weekly on Thursdays to discuss both lectures and assignments. At each meetup we'll discuss the previous week's lectures and the current assignment. You should have watched the lectures and at least made a start on the assignment, if not completed it. Doors open 7pm. Meetup starts 7:30pm and usually runs to 9:00/9:30pm. Bring dinner/snacks and/or eat beforehand. Press 06160🔔 at the intercom downstairs so we can buzz you in.

At the end of two hours, you will learn to write simple code in Python and execute the program. This lesson is targeted at new beginners who have no prior background in coding. If you have experienced programming before, this course's pace might be too slow for you. As spaces are limited, priority goes to new programmers. This is a very basic course, we highly recommend it to anyone who's interested to pick up coding even if you have no prior background at all. For this lesson, you must bring along your own computer (any system) and be prepared to learn how to write code! There are no other prerequisites.","location":"Tri5 Ventures, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #03-26, S139951, Singapore","rsvp_count":32,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code/events/243330473/","group_id":25157730,"group_name":"Singaporeans Learning To Code","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code","formatted_time":"28 Sep 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-09-28T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-28T13:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.296735,"longitude":103.78669},{"id":"242704205","name":"IxD Session: A conversation with Aditi Kulkarni, Head of Design, Referral Candy","description":"Hey everyone! We're back once again in September for this Design Leader series where we have a conversation with Design leaders, Principle consultants, influential designers improving lives through UX.  This month we'll be speaking with Aditi Kulkarni, Head of Design &amp; UX at Singapore based startup, ReferralCandy.

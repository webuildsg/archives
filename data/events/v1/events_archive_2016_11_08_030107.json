Specifically, presentation using ipython notebook will go through details such as - 1) data pre-processing, 2) Using mllib random forest classifier for binary classification, 3) Measuring performance using AUC score, 4) Different strategies to handle the problem of unbalanced dataset Speaker: Weimin Wang - works as Data Scientist in Merck Singapore. During his job, he focuses on Advanced Analytics and Bioinformatics Research. With solid knowledge in Data Mining and Machine Learning. Weimin is also actively involved in Data Science competitions like Kaggle and Data Science Game. His interests lie in Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. Incremental Data Processing with Apache Spark on Azure HDInsight Synopsis: Social media, like Facebook and Twitter, have data feeds that contain a wealth of information that can aid in trend discovery. We recently worked with the United Nations to parse incoming social feed information to enable the UN to watch for trending keywords that could alert them to potential humanitarian crises like food shortages and terrorist attacks. One typical pattern for efficiently processing evolving datasets like this is to process the new slice of data incrementally and merge the results with previous results. In this talk, I will discuss how you can use incremental processing to make your data pipeline more efficient. Speaker: Rita Zhang (https://twitter.com/ritazzhang) is an Open Source Engineer at Microsoft, based in San Francisco, hacking away with engineering teams, open source communities, and startups using emerging open source technologies, and sharing technical collaterals with the developer community.

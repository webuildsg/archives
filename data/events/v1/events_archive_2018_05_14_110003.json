How can we innovate to create solutions that will help Singaporeans adopt a mindset of lifelong learning, and keep up with the effects of disruptive technologies? Experts will share their points of view on the current trends and developments in the field of learning. This is your opportunity to join the discussion, learn about the space, and find out what to expect at the hackathon. \nAlso, this will be your chance to meet like-minded innovators and form teams for the hackathon! \n\nChallenges \nNew and emerging technologies are set to disrupt the way we work. Hence, we need to continually evolve the way we learn and acquire skills. We want to encourage peer-to-peer learning, enable organisations to adapt and integrate learning, and invent new ways of tracking and benchmarking. \n1. Learning as a Community: Shifting away from a traditional classroom model of learning, peer-to-peer and decentralised learning platforms present opportunities for the access to learning through mediums that people use every day.\nThe knowledge exchange creates value by leveraging shared expertise and resources contributed by the community as well as the learner himself or herself. Early adopters can lead with their “pro-sumer” (professional consumer) contributions.\nThe threshold of learning is also reduced – these platforms are easy to join and use through better design (for example, gamification, user interface, etc.).\nHow might we inspire and empower individuals to learn from and with their peers?\n2. Adaptive Organisations: As the demands of the workforce evolve to a culture of growth and engagement with meaningful tasks, organisations are challenged to provide customised – even personalised – training opportunities for their employees.\nThis will require aligning workplace demands with the aspirations, passions, needs, and preferred ways of learning of individuals.\nIndividuals have access to platforms and tools that provide the necessary knowledge “just in time” to perform a specific task or assignment and are flexible enough to overcome the perennial employee complaint – lack of time.\nHow might we enable organisations to adapt and integrate learning, such that the way we work becomes the way we learn?\n3. Track & Benchmark: As we establish new pathways of success, we must also build the appropriate infrastructure to support the ecosystem of individual employees and their organisations, entrepreneurs, and government. For example, with informal learning, a new system to track and reward both contributors and learners will need to be designed.\nNew ways of acknowledging and conferring credentials – supplementing present-day formal accreditation systems – can encourage organisations to hire based on capabilities rather than paper qualifications. It can also promote adaptive accumulation of skills by individuals and help them understand where they are on their path to skills mastery.\nSuch decentralised forms of learning, tracking, and benchmarking can be made possible by new and emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI. Big Data coupled with a Design Thinking mindset enables organisations to continuously experiment, validate, and innovate.\nHow might we motivate and support new ways of learning with tracking and benchmarking tools?\nLearn more about the challenges here, or join us at the Pre-Hackathon Workshop where we'll discuss them in detail with industry experts. \n\nAlso, don't forget to check out the SkillsFuture Singapore Hackathon 2018, where you can collaborate and build the solution that will lay the foundation of the Future of Learning, and stand to win from a prize pool of $12,500! \nIf you have any questions, drop us an email at hello@upsingapore.com. ","location":"LEVEL3, Mapletree Business City, 20 Pasir Panjang Road,, East Wing,  #03-22/24, Singapore 117439","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/pre-hackathon-workshop-skillsfuture-singapore-hackathon-2018-tickets-45056439022?aff=ebapi","group_id":"3543644077","group_name":"UP Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/up-singapore-3543644077","formatted_time":"14 May 2018, Mon, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-05-14T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-05-14T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"cpmhmpyxhbcb","name":"Topic - Sprint Planning","description":"Sprint planning topics to discuss and duration.

He is currently visiting Singapore and agreed to give two talks related to his work. One talk is on his current main project, an analytics platform for connected vehicles that has largely been implemented in Erlang. The other is on his experience with introducing Erlang in a mature organization. Agenda:• 6:45 pm - 7:10 pm : Snacks - Pizzas, drinks, mingling• 7:10 pm : OODIDA: On-board/Off-board Distributed Data Analytics for Connected Vehicles• 8:00 pm : Break• 8:10 pm : Introducing Erlang in the Workplace (Experience Report) Thanks for all the following volunteers Pizza Sponsorer: Yojee.Venue provider: Kaligo.Organizing:Anil Thaplar (@athaplar| [masked])Grzegorz (@arnvald | [masked]) Speaker: Gregor Ulm, Research and Development Engineer at the Fraunhofer-Chalmers Research Centre for Industrial Mathematics (FCC), Gothenburg, Sweden Talks: 1. OODIDA: On-board/Off-board Distributed Data Analytics for Connected VehiclesA modern connected vehicle generates dozens of gigabytes of data per hour, which implies that central data processing (off-board) of a fleet of connected vehicles is not feasible. Instead, a large part of data processing has to happen locally on the client (on-board). The OODIDA platform facilitates concurrent distributed data analytics. Its key feature is the ability to concurrently execute multiple distributed data analytics tasks on overlapping subsets of client devices. This talk gives an overview of OODIDA, which is largely implemented in Erlang, discusses design considerations, and highlights various use cases, ranging from the simple, such as filtering, to the more complex, such as coordinating and executing distributed machine learning tasks with a large number of client devices. OODIDA is an ongoing research project at FCC. It is carried out in collaboration with industry partners. 2. Introducing Erlang in the Workplace (Experience Report)The number of developers with an interest in functional programming seems to easily outnumber the number of industry jobs that entail using functional programming in practice. However, you don't have to only use functional programming languages in your spare time! One approach to get a job as a functional programmer would be to launch your own startup or join one of the comparably few companies that prominently use a functional programming language. A different approach is to introduce a functional programming language in your own workplace. In this talk, I discuss how I introduced Erlang at FCC in early 2017, and got it adopted for a major project. Since then, we filled several internship positions and, much more importantly, very recently hired two full-time Erlang developers and thus actively grew the local Erlang community.

When designing flood proof urban regions, an understanding of the often complex water-system is essential. In her lecture, Anne Loes will show a multi-disciplinary ‘research by design’ approach, in which water serves as a guiding design principle for resilient urban regions. \nShe will show examples of the application of this approach for the Dutch Delta Programme, the Bangladesh Deltaplan and the Houston Galveston bay area. As a result of the different physical, economical and political contexts, the approach in different regions, leads to completely different design strategies.\nSpeaker: Anne Loes Nillesen\nhttp://www.d.efac.to/ \nAnne Loes Nillesen is founding director of urban design firm Defacto, The Netherlands. Defacto specializes in urban research and design in the domain of water and flood risk management. She worked on complex, large-scale urban design and flood risk management assignments such as the Dutch Delta Programme and Bangladesh Deltaplan, and several regional and local scale adaptation projects, amongst which a barrier design for Houston. She currently works on the ‘Water as Leverage for Resilient Cities Asia’ project for Khulna, Bangladesh. Also, Anne Loes founded the Climate Adaptation Lab and Delta Interventions integral Msc graduate studios at Delft University of Technology.","location":"Value Lab Asia, Singapore-ETH Centre, #06-01, CREATE Tower, 1 Create Way, Singapore 138602","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/fcl-lunch-talk-designing-flood-proof-urban-regions-tickets-48943289697?aff=ebapi","group_id":"17260566074","group_name":"Future Cities Laboratory","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/future-cities-laboratory-17260566074","formatted_time":"15 Aug 2018, Wed, 11:00 am","start_time":"2018-08-15T03:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"48721664811","name":"FCL Lunch Talk: Palm oil sustainability and ‘big data’ indicators","description":"FCL Lunch Talk: Palm oil sustainability and ‘big data’ indicators\nYu-Leng will present her recent work on sub-regional or landscape-level data that feeds into “No-deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” and UN Sustainable Development Goal indicators. She will be presenting: a) her efforts on using satellite imagery to assess historical land-use of palm oil plantation areas in critical areas of Malaysia and Indonesia; and b) her work on assessing and quantifying labour and other socio-economic issues. This work develops a more nuanced and fair understanding of the different variables and contexts that impact indicators. Notably, her findings help to demystify data on “tree cover loss” that confuses the public about deforestation in long-in-production zones. For instance, her case study of Johor, Malaysia finds 99% of areas to be in-use by 1985, beating popular sustainability schemes by 20-30 years. She reviews human development indices across Indonesia and within Riau, and for FELDA and selected rural Malaysia areas for livelihood measured across decades.\nSpeaker: Yu-Leng Khor\nhttps://www.khor-reports.com/ \nYu-Leng KHOR is a commercial economist based in Southeast Asia. She incorporates big data, geospatial analytics and social listening, plus deep-dive market intelligence and risk analysis in her work across multi-sectors. In the commodity space she works on sustainable supply-chains (palm, wood, sweeteners, biomass-renewables etc.) and markets.  She was a lead economist on the 2017 palm oil study for the EU Commission. Yu Leng is Research Associate at the Institute of China Studies, University Malaya and was Visiting Fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in 2013. She has published on smallholder socio-economics, rural voting behaviour, China and regional development.","location":"Value Lab Asia, Singapore-ETH Centre, #06-01, CREATE Tower, 1 Create Way, Singapore 138602","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/fcl-lunch-talk-palm-oil-sustainability-and-big-data-indicators-tickets-48721664811?aff=ebapi","group_id":"17260566074","group_name":"Future Cities Laboratory","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/future-cities-laboratory-17260566074","formatted_time":"15 Aug 2018, Wed, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2018-08-15T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-08-15T05:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"48824195483","name":"Gamification and Safety Training | FutureSafe Tech","description":"Come join us as we walk you through the future of training via our Gamified Safety Training Simulator. Agenda:\n\n\nIntroduction to Gamification and FutureSafe\nLive Demo of Application\nHands on experience for all participants\nTheory behind the Design\nWorking Together\n\n\nLight refreshments will be served. \n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQzUSMXpcGM\n","location":"390 Havelock Rd, King's Centre, Murdoch Singapore, #03-01, Singapore 169662","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/gamification-and-safety-training-futuresafe-tech-tickets-48824195483?aff=ebapi","group_id":"17656388571","group_name":"FutureSafe Tech","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/futuresafe-tech-17656388571","formatted_time":"15 Aug 2018, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2018-08-15T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-08-15T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"}]}

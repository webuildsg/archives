And, as always, we're actively look for more speakers - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10). The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor. It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

About Shah Shah is the Head of Design and Strategy at Palo IT, where he's trying to build the next generation of designers &amp; strategists. He has been working in the digital space since 1998 in Australia, Jakarta and now Singapore. He has worked with global and regional clients in the government sector, high-tech, retail, telco and finance on UX Analytics (measurable user experience design) solutions for cross channels delivery across desktop, tablet and mobile. He loves working in complex problem space where he can collaboratively create and optimise the appropriate experiences with the aim of delivering value to the business by delighting its customers through well-crafted and appropriate design solutions. Shah believes the role of a designer is more than delivering tactical executions. He is still continuously learning on how customer empathy can be used to articulate appropriate insights that help bridge business needs and its customers across the appropriate digital channels. Also, Shah thinks fifth graders are way smarter than him. Agenda for the night 7pm – 7.30pm: Registration, drinks, snacks and networking7.30pm – 8.30pm: Conversation with Shah8.30pm – 9pm: Networking and drinks :) We're hoping to keep the session really informal and casual where it is more conversational centric so bring along some of your burning questions to the session. The value of the meetup is as good as the questions asked :) Also, if you would like to ask the question privately, please email me at kiat@ixda.sg and I'll ask them on your behalf :) Alternatively, you may like to tweet us the questions to @IxDASG (https://twitter.com/IxDASG) and we can have that answered!

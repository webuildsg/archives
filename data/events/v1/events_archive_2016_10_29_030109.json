With any luck, we should have some new Shapeways models to explore and we encourage all who have printed some models with shapeways to bring them down to share and showcase too! One of the materials we will focus on for this time will be the mostly brittle Coloured Sandstone 3d prints. If our test pieces arrive in time, we will be doing some experimental coatings followed by stress and drop tests to see how they fare! Another key feature (thought not Shapeways Printed) will be the massive Torbjorn Turret from Overwatch which we have been working on since the last meetup too! With any luck, we will have a few other prop pieces ready by then too! So feel free to come by, join in and just hang out with us! =)","location":"Funbie Studios, Liang Court, #B1-07, 177 River Valley Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":1,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Shapeways-Singapore/events/235121484/","group_id":19108946,"group_name":"Shapeways Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Shapeways-Singapore","formatted_time":"29 Oct 2016, Sat, 5:00 pm","start_time":"2016-10-29T09:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-29T11:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.291531,"longitude":103.844612}]}

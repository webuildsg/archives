Also, at the very least, please have the Anaconda Distribution of Python 3.5 installed if you want to have a go at trying out what is shared. Other packages you might need include Tensorflow and OpenCV. Technical session for those of us working on projects of the Udacity Self-driving Car Engineer nanodegree, and people from industry working in or interested in related fields like deep learning, computer vision and robotics. Expected to have people working on lane detection using OpenCV, and Tensorflow CNNs for Computer Vision (eg. Traffic Sign Classification) and Behavioural Cloning. Beginners certainly welcomed as well, but must be willing or interested to get technical. Tentative flow of the event: 7-7.15pm Pizzas and getting to know each other [masked]pm Udacity Oct/Nov batch nanodegree students can share on the projects they have done so far, on: • using OpenCV for a simple lane line detection algorithm • implementing a Convolutional Neural Network using Tensorflow for Traffic Sign classification 8.30-9pm Open mic for anyone to share about the work in related fields which they have done 9-10pm Breakout into different groups to try out what was shared For people just generally interested in the field, we would be having community events with startups and speakers in the future which you are more than welcomed to join. Technical Working Sessions like this one are to be kept strictly technical, to maximise the productivity of the participants.","location":"IMDA Lab @ National Design Center , #03-04 111 Middle Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":55,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup/events/235855668/","group_id":21292690,"group_name":"Singapore Self-driving Car Engineering Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup","formatted_time":"02 Dec 2016, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-12-02T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-12-02T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.298824,"longitude":103.853508},{"id":"qndnvlyvqbdb","name":"Let's meet to share about improvised lab equipment and home experiments","description":"This commences a series of regular meet-ups, tentatively scheduled for the first Friday evening of the month.

Partnered with Google. User Experience Design is often thought about as the last mile in the product development process. In the past few years, Google has launched several products that are relevant to users who are coming online for the very first time. While building these products, Google learnt that User Experience (UX) is not just a designer's job. With successful collaboration with business development, marketing, engineering and product management teams we have integrated designing thing deep into our product development cycle. This session will focus on what it means for products team to be design-driven with some examples and success stories.

Test-driven development (TDD) is a style of development where coding, testing, and design are tightly interwoven. As opposed to the traditional way of development, TDD requires you to write a test before you write the actual code. In this workshop, we will discuss the essence of what makes TDD work and show how understanding the principles means that we can use tests to help us deliver more effectively. This workshop is facilitated by our network member Fay Adams.

The inability to scale to the demands of internet-scale user base however, has limited the real-world applications of blockchains. Zilliqa is a new high-throughput public blockchain platform that can enable real-world applications hitherto not possible. The novel idea that makes Zilliqa scalable is the concept of sharding. Proposed by some of the Zilliqa team members in a research paper, the idea of sharding has been brought to life with the Zilliqa testnet (first globally). Zilliqa testnet can reach thousands of transactions per second without sacrificing security and decentralization. Join us on 23 May, 2018 (Wednesday) to find out more about our progress, which partners are coming onboard, key initiatives and a preview of our new smart contract language Scilla that enables unprecedented security for smart contracts.

Profede is based on the open source Ethereum technology and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) distributed computing platform. The EVM runs smart contracts (pieces of code) stored in the blockchain ensuring the rules defined by Profede. Professional behavior and data is worth billions to businesses.Why shouldn’t professionals be compensated for this?In the current professional ecosystem, businesses are forced to pay large amounts of capital to recruiting and social selling “intermediaries”, who target contacts but provide little-to-no direct value to the professional. Why should professionals do all the work while intermediaries reap all the benefits? The SolutionProfessionals should have control over who can receive their professional data and how others can use it. Our decentralized professional ecosystem helps you get compensated for your data, making intermediaries unnecessary. Profede is the next generation of professional data privacy. Thanks to blockchain, you can be sure your data is protected. ￼ Professionals Make The Money Instead of the intermediaries, professionals will be the ones who are fairly compensated every time a business gets in touch with them. ￼ Join the Fun Cryptocurrencies are booming!

But what does it mean for software development and operations points of view? Is there a difference in technical skills of people who focus mostly on development or operations? Developers are becoming more and more familiar with technical practices like TDD and refactoring and modern tools like Jenkins and Cucumber. Such practices and tools help them write better code. For operations, it seems like there are only modern tools like Ansible and Docker, and little focus on good technical practices. Do sysadmins only like to discover new tools? More and more people recognize the value of full-stack engineers and cross-functional teams. We hear about continuous delivery, continuous deployment, continuous integration. It may indicate different activities performed by different people, but they are very closely related. All software projects contain both application code and operations and maintenance scripts. Everything is just code and must be treated in the same way. When teams try to adopt DevOps without treating operations scripts with the same diligence as software code, they will usually face problems. Introducing new modern tools like Ansible and Kubernetes cannot solve those problems automatically. This presentation is about another perspective on DevOps and how to avoid those problems. It is split into three parts: 1. Why Dev and Ops are the same things2. Which problems disappear when you consider Dev and Ops as the same thing3. How to do a better DevOps adoption ### About Chai Feng Chai Feng is a software developer and a technical coach at Odd-e. He has over 15 years of programming experience as well as leading technical teams. He is also experienced in Unix and Linux systems, IT operations, automated testing (mobile/web/desktop) and continuous delivery. Since he joined Odd-e in 2014, he shares his experience as a coach by helping teams to develop better engineering practices such as Test-driven development, Specification by Examples, Refactoring, Continuous Integration, etc. More recently he has also been helping teams to adopt DevOps practices. He has worked on product development in various industries including banking, insurance, telecommunications, healthcare, education, and government. He has built embedded applications, mobile communication gateway, web and mobile applications. ### Agenda 7:00pm Networking with refreshments7:30pm Presentation8:00pm Discussion9:00pm End","location":"Credit Suisse, Wealth Institute, Level 2 North Tower, One Raffles Link, Singapore","rsvp_count":100,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Agile-Singapore/events/250126595/","group_id":1704608,"group_name":"Agile Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Agile-Singapore","formatted_time":"23 May 2018, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2018-05-23T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-05-23T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.292045,"longitude":103.855843},{"id":"250962557","name":"Blockchain in EdTech and HRTech - #Crypto to the Next Frontier","description":"Hi there! It is the #industry40 and technological advancements are here to stay. It is said that 40% of jobs will change by 2020. What we see and know today may not be relevant in the near future. In this event, we explore that to heart focusing on two key aspects of how we live. Education: Education has only started to change in the last 10 years. With the introduction of Blackboard, schools have started to pick up technological tools to help in classroom learning. But things are now starting to change in the 20th century due to two key things. Game-Based Learning: In the 1980s, MIT professor Thomas Malone (1981) maintained that games motivate players with elements of challenge, fantasy and curiosity. Given numerous studies support the positive effects of games on learning, a growing number of researchers are committed to developing educational games to promote students’ 21st-century skill development in schools. However what is unique now is the manner of internet penetration, mobile, and accessibility to connections that can bring Games to Real Life. Coupled with Blockchain (To be described below), an integrated solution could be revolutionary. In this session - we talk about one use-case has been sponsored by the Singapore government and in BETA with education institutions in Singapore to trial this. Whats especially exciting in Blockchain is the usecase for credentials signaling and an eco-system to facilitate and support references. Blockchain: Blockchain is at the forefront of today’s technological and financial innovation with pulpits prophesizing its creation being equivalent to the invention of the internet. It is the technology that underpins Bitcoin transactions. Blockchain is a shared database that is secure and anonymous and allows the exchange of goods and documents in a secure way without the involvement of third parties or having to carry out time-consuming tasks for the sake of transparency in order to assess risks and avoid fraud. But learning the Blockchain is never easy. 50% of the success of the Blockchain is non-tech often not talked about and even less research on. In this 2 hour session, the two soaring Blockchain Entrepreneurs will share about the tech, the philosophy, and the resulting ideas to help de-mystify Blockchain in Personal Growth and Business. What is a Blockchain and what makes it so special amongst the other revolutionary concepts that has graced this century? The event ends in a panel discussion about where we are, how the public could join the community, contribute to Blockchain and how to get started.

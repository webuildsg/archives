In addition, many Propulsion Improving Devices (PID) have been invented, later abandoned and then reinvented and reintroduced in conjunction with energy crisis. Nowadays the PID portfolio spans over pre-swirlers, swirl recoverers, ducts, hull fins, rudder fins, bulbed or twisted rudders, hub caps... either alone or combined one with the other.\nOn the contrary propellers have gone through very little innovation: little is worth mentioning apart from the introduction of high skew and a continuous improvement of the annular profiles.\nAt the same time two types of unconventional propellers have been developed: surface propellers, which bear little interest for commercial shipping, and Unconventional Tip Shape Propellers.\nSince then the Unconventional Tip Shape Propeller concept has evolved continuously and nowadays two different types of Unconventional Tip Shape Propellers are available for ship propulsion: MAN Kappel propellers and SISTEMAR CLT ® propellers.\nFrom late 80's Unconventional Tip Shape Propellers, in particular of CLT type, have been installed in relatively high number at full scale (about 400 vessels, from hydrofoils to bulk carriers, from Ro-Pax to VLCC) and have always shown their superior performance when compared to conventional propellers.\nDespite this fact Unconventional Tip Shape Propellers are still unbeknown to most Ship Owners, Technical Managers, Ship Designers and Shipyards.\nIn this context it should be noted that propellers considered “new” by employing technologies such as, Tip Rake, Wide Tip Chord and New / Advanced Profiles are conventional propellers in all respects. They can offer limited advantages over “standard” conventional propeller designs but they cannot rival the propulsive efficiency of Unconventional Tip Shape Propellers.\nDuring the technical talk a comprehensive technology review of Unconventional Tip Shape Propellers, and in particular of CLT propellers, will presented with the aim of promoting their knowledge and use, both for new building and as retrofit.\n\nAbout the Speaker\nGiulio Gennaro received is education in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Genoa. After graduating he moved to Augsburg, Germany, where he worked for MAN & Diesel, first as test bed engineer then as Turbocharging R&D engineer. He then joined RINA HQ, Genoa, where he was responsible for plan approval, type approval and calculations for machinery, in particular Diesel engines, gearboxes, shatlines and propellers. In 2003 he started working as freelance independent consultant, focusing on failure investigation, root cause analysis, litigation support and forensic engineering, in particular in relations to plants and machinery, both for naval, onshore and offshore applications. In parallel he started cooperating with Sistemar, Madrid, a company responsible for the development and the design of Contracted and Loaded Tip Propellers (CLT Propellers). Thanks to his collaboration with Sistemar he has developed a deep understanding and insight of naval propulsion, propeller design and propulsion monitoring. He has taken part in many international activities and R&D campaigns on naval propulsion together with leading players and institutions such as Carnival Corporation, A.P. Moeller Maersk, US Navy, VTT, HSVA, CEHIPAR, ABB... He is the author and co-author of many papers on non-conventional propeller and ship propulsion.\nHe was a guest lecturer at the University of Genoa on subjects such as Failure Investigation, ship valuation, H&M and P&I surveys, Risk Assessment.\nHe moved to Singapore in January 2015 as Technical Director of RockTree, a shipping / logistic company managing Offshore Floating Transhippers, there he focused on improving maintenance practices and overall reliability and availability of the plants and on digitalization.\nIn 2017 he incorporated his consultancy company in Singapore providing high level technical consultancies in relation to failure investigation, litigation support, forensic engineering and propulsion optimisation / energy saving.\nHe is Member of AIPAM, the Italian Association of Expert in Maritime Casualties. He is Member of SNAMES, the Society of Naval Architects an Marine Engineers, Singapore. He is Member of the Technical Committee on LNG Bunkering, Singapore.

These families are distinguished by their purposes, and the kinds of data that is required to use them. This talk will introduce data science through an overview of its methods and where they may be applied. This talk is crafted to be accessible to the non-technical, but to also be of interest to the technologist. Hopefully, even a practicing data scientist may find something of interest. We will begin by discussing a past data science project to give those interested in data science an idea of what a project might entail. Then, we will talk about the various families of methods and how they might be used. We will conclude by touching on how one can get started with data science. This event is sponsored by UpCode Academy. About the speaker:This talk will be conducted by our Head of Data Science, Jeremy. Jeremy holds a PhD in Decision Sciences at the National University of Singapore and a Master's Degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Computation for Design and Optimization, where he did a thesis on randomised methods for convex optimization. Jeremy later earned a PhD in Decision Sciences at the National University of Singapore in 2017, with a thesis on \"Social Networks and the Choices People Make\" (discrete choice on social networks). During his PhD days, he also worked on recommendation systems and a start-up building solutions for compliance in pharmaceutical manufacturing.","location":"Tri5 Ventures, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #03-26, S139951, Singapore","rsvp_count":23,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code/events/250404496/","group_id":25157730,"group_name":"Singaporeans Learning To Code","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code","formatted_time":"10 May 2018, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2018-05-10T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-05-10T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.296735,"longitude":103.78669},{"id":"250334845","name":"External OIDC, Identity Server, and UI Framework Blazor","description":"Details In this meetup, we are proud to have Riza Marhaban and Dawa Law to join us to talk about two exciting topics which are related to the trending technologies, Identity Server, Xamarin, and Blazor.

Fysical is a decentralized location data market. It is the infrastructure for the transparent and compliant exchange of location data. Data suppliers currently contribute over 15 billion data points per month to Fysical, and the datasets consist of foot traffic sensor readings, store visit data, commute routes, and much more. Check out these case studies that have been created using location data from Fysical:- Location Data Proves Racially Diverse Crypto Crowds Are Wealthiest: https://medium.com/fysicalblog/location-data-proves-racially-diverse-crypto-crowds-are-the-wealthiest-d434d13b9f45- The Women's March had 3x the attendance as Trump's Inauguration: https://medium.com/fysicalblog/the-2017-womens-march-in-washington-had-3x-the-attendance-as-trump-s-inauguration-267fc7f6968c Speaker:Ben Smith, Founder at Fysical (fysical.org), Boston University 12'","location":"Paypal Innovation Lab, 5 Temasek Boulevard #07-01, Suntec Tower 5, Singapore, 038985","rsvp_count":110,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/249221461/","group_id":18519858,"group_name":"Ethereum Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore","formatted_time":"09 Apr 2018, Mon, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-04-09T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-04-09T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.294551,"longitude":103.858253},{"id":"249484793","name":"Making Open Hardware - Pocket Science Lab for All","description":"Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) is a project developed by FOSSASIA. The goal is to create an Open Source hardware device (open on all layers) that can be used for experiments by teachers, students and citizen scientists. At this meetup, PSLab Team will walk you through the entire development and production of the device. We will also share the latest updates. This tiny pocket lab provides an array of sensors for doing science and engineering experiments. It comes with functions of numerous measurement devices including an oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, a programmable voltage, current source and as a data logger. Join us next Monday to learn more!

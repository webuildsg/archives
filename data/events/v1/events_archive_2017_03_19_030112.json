Please join us to learn about how Blockchain is changing the automotive industry at Daimler, get insights to Hyperledger from a tech perspective, test the Canaan AvalonMiner embedded Hardware using OpenWrt and meet startups in lightning talk sessions. The FOSSASIA OpenTech Summit 2017 hosts the track including with these presentations: • Blockchain Technologies - Hyperledger, Justin Lee (Singapore) • Daimler - Blockchain in the Automotive Industry (Vlado Koljibabic &amp; Jan Michael Graef, (Germany, CFO of CASE, Connected, Autonomous, Shared &amp; Services, Electric; newly established entity within Mercedes-Benz) • Blockchain OpenWrt Software for Hardware: The Canaan AvalonMiner Open Source Embedded System. Fengling Qin (China) • Lightning Talks • Gaurang Torvekar CTO/Co-Founder Attores. Gaurang will be speaking about Attores' latest offering, Open Certificates. Attores helps organisations and institutions digitise their documents and certificates on the blockchain using Smart Contracts technology. Attores is looking to drive open standards for Ethereum and Hyperledger blockchains for the area of Certifications and documents. Gaurang will speak about their offering and how the open source community can help them drive these forward. • Toby Hoenisch CEO &amp; Founder OnePay Pte Ltd. He will be speaking about COMIT. COMIT is a super blockchain network that allows for instant transactions which are enforced using off-chain smart contracts. It leverages Payment Channels and Hashed Timelock Contracts (HTLC) across chains to solve the problem of double spend attacks without requiring a settlement onto the underlying blockchains. \n\n\nGET FREE TICKETS BEFORE MARCH 13 1) Sign up now on the meetup group. 2) The quickest attendees using the following link will get free entrance on Sunday https://eventyay.com/e/45da88b7/?code=DAIMLERBLOCKCHAIN(Ticket numbers are limited. Please choose ticket \"Blockchain Track\" and signup before March 13, after that 20% off the community ticket). \n\n\nDAIMLER - BLOCKCHAIN IN THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY  Daimler AG is one of the world's most successful automotive companies. With its Mercedes-Benz Cars, Daimler Trucks, Mercedes-Benz Vans, Daimler Buses, and Daimler Financial Services divisions, the Group is one of the leading global suppliers of premium cars and is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial vehicles. CASE – these letters will shape the future of Mercedes-Benz Cars. They stand for the strategic pillars of connectivity (Connected), autonomous driving (Autonomous), flexible use (Shared &amp; Services) and electric drive systems (Electric), which will be intelligently combined with one another by the company. Core to our future products is software and as part of this vision, we are increasing our direct engagement with the global open source community. In this session, we will share some insights on how Daimler is aligning with open source communities such as Linux and Hyperledger. We are pleased to present an interesting pilot we are developing using blockchain technology for Trucks financing, some results of which we would love to discuss with blockchain enthusiasts of FOSSASIA. \n\n\nBLOCKCHAIN SOFTWARE FOR HARDWARE: THE CANAAN AVALONMINER WITH OPENSOURCE EMBEDDED SYSTEMS The Canaan AvalonMiner 721 is hardware blockchain securing hardware technology built using Open Source software. The latest hardware AvalonMiner 721 contains 72 customized ASIC processors named Canaan A3212 which are harmonized together and then across potentially thousands of other AvalonMiners, to do SHA-256 hashing calculations. From the software toolchain all the way to OpenWrt used in Canaan's AvalonMiner Controller, this presentation describes the entire process from start to finish how the software is built, developed, launched and maintained. Of specific interest are the contributions by Canaan back to the Open Source community, including to CGMiner, OpenWRT and other projects.

We will explore the world of memory layouts, garbage collection, JIT compilation, walking through the behavior of many real-world code examples.  By the end of this session, you should be much more familiar with the inner workings of the JVM that many of us take for granted, and hopefully will be better prepared to respond next time your Java application goes bump in the night.

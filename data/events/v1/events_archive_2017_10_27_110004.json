This week, we have NUSgem who will be talking about customized kill switches, and we have Vaibhav who will be talking about implementing our own Git with Haskell. See you there!\n\nDate/Time: Friday, October 27 at 6:30pm\nVenue: SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS\nFree pizza is served before the talks.\n\nTalk 1: Making Engineering of Customised Kill Switches Easier\n\nTalk Description\nMany SynBio groups are engineering microbes that could one day be useful in detecting diseases, fighting cancer and monitoring heavy metals in rivers. However, engineered microbes may leak into the non-designated environment, posing threats to our natural ecosystem. This is a major hurdle towards the commercialization of engineered microbes. To address this, we need effective kill switches to prevent engineered microbes from escaping into the environment.\n\nTeam NUSgem aims to make engineering of customised, effective kill switches easier. To this end, we are developing a library of characterized sensors, a killing and verification module which can be used in a computer-aided design tool and can be readily modelled. This talk aims to provide an introduction to modelling genetic circuits in synthetic biology.\n\nSpeaker Profile\nWilbert, Khue and Wenhao are from NUSGem. NUSgem is a team of seven NUS students from different faculties competing in the prestigious synthetic biology competition, iGEM. We like bacteria, models and hotpot.\n\n\nTalk 2: I Haskell A Git\n\nTalk Description\nGit has a reputation for being obtuse and difficult to use. Part of this reputation stems from a focus on understanding the intricate details of the UI instead of forming a mental model of what the tool is actually doing. To address this, we’re going to implement our own Git, and confirm that it works as we expect.\n\nSpeaker Profile\nVaibhav is a programmer in search of better tools and techniques. After writing lots of bugs as a web developer, he took some time off to attend a batch at the Recurse Center and make sense of this functional programming thing. Now he manages servers for Zalora.\n\nSupported by:\nThe HANGAR by NUS Enterprise — the campus hub for entrepreneurs.","location":"SR3, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS, , Singapore","rsvp_count":6,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/887029774805992","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"27 Oct 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-10-27T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-10-27T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"108000839964716","name":"TGIFHacks #71 - Make Yourself a Django Server","description":"In this week’s workshop, we will learn how to host a basic Django development server, entirely on our own machine. We will build some simple websites, and then move on to more complicated applications that can communicate with one another (like some kind of hacky IOT thing).\n\nAll you need for this workshop is a laptop, a text editor (like Sublime Text, Atom or Notepad++), Python 3 (with Django and Requests installed), and Ngrok. To get the most out of this workshop, we recommend all attendees to have basic knowledge on Python syntax.\n\nSpeaker: Ye Fan (Steve)\n\nPrerequisites: Python\nWhat to install?: Text Editor (Sublime, Atom), Ngrok, Python 3.6.x (with packages: Django, Requests)","location":"The Nest Theatre @ Innovation Centre, 16 Nanyang Drive, Singapore 637722","rsvp_count":19,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/108000839964716","group_id":"219467331408976","group_name":"NTU Open Source Society","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/219467331408976","formatted_time":"27 Oct 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-10-27T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-10-27T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.3421251123333,"longitude":103.68325381067}]}

To prevent this, the industry spends billions of dollars every year to monitor the construction sites by reading thousands of scattered sensors using kilometers of cables, or a specialized workforce. These solutions are expensive, error prone, and hard to manage. At Ackcio, we build extremely reliable wireless monitoring solutions that can totally eliminate cables and reduce the dependence of manpower. Using this technology, we are automating the process of gathering construction data that can be analysed to spot disasters way before they occur, and even help constructors build buildings smarter.   Bio: Nimantha is the Co-Founder and CEO of Ackcio. He obtained his PhD from NUS, specialising in wireless networks. His patent-pending techniques on improving VoIP quality on Wi-Fi networks have been integrated in Skype.

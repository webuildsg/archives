High-Level Language (week 4 of the course) and the project from chapter 9 / week 3.  \"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed.\" Shimon Schocken, the author of the book talks about the course at TED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs How Book Club Works1.

Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3.

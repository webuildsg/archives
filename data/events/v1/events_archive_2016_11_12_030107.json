Location Update: We are having the event at General Assembly's office which is very close to Orchard MRT, it's basically right behind DFS T Galleria.Exit to Shaw from Orchard MRTWalk along the new Michelin 1 Star queue at Pacific Plaza to the back and up a slope to get to 8 Claymore Hill.Use Google Map if you'd not sure! If you're wondering what you can do - don't worry. If you know another language beyond English, you'd be helping make WordPress accessible and useful to the non-English speaking world (which if you don't know, is much bigger than the English speaking population).So come down, contribute to WordPress in your mother tongue or 3rd language. We'll show you how.","location":"General Assembly Office, 8 Claymore Hill #03-01, Singapore","rsvp_count":27,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/WordPress-Singapore/events/235173552/","group_id":18556372,"group_name":"WordPress Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/WordPress-Singapore","formatted_time":"12 Nov 2016, Sat, 9:30 am","start_time":"2016-11-12T01:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-11-12T04:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.307712,"longitude":103.831764},{"id":"gkbv1ermmm4mouh1rgq7ptlqv0","name":"KopiJS #31","description":"https://github.com/KopiJS/kopi.js/issues/53","location":"A Poke Theory, 27 Boon Tat St, Singapore 069623","url":"https://github.com/KopiJS/kopi.js/issues/53","group_name":"KopiJS","group_url":"http://kopi.io/","formatted_time":"12 Nov 2016, Sat, 10:48 am","start_time":"2016-11-12T02:48:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-11-12T04:48:00.000Z","platform":"ics"},{"id":"234776017","name":"QuantCon Hackathon","description":"QuantCon Singapore Competition The QuantCon Hackathon is a free, quantitative finance competition that runs from 11AM ~ 6PM in Singapore.

It’s a fashionable, new paradigm for modelling asynchronous events in a composable, declarative way. Our mobile developers decided to be trendy, and adopted the world of Observables (aka Signals, Streams) in production. It definitely helped them wade through complex async flows. As code became declarative, it became easier to reason about expected behaviour. Bugs began to flee. Our developers began finding spare time to gym and watch Game of Thrones. Life was good. Or was it? As with any technology in production, they discovered a host of interesting issues that the tutorials and toy projects never mentioned... This talk will cover the fundamentals of Reactive Programming on iOS and Android. It will also include a much needed debate on issues with the paradigm in production. \n\n\nSpeakers Omer Iqbal iOS Dev who drinks functional programming coolaid for breakfast. Unnaturally obsessed with compilers.  Yang Bo Android dev (since before froyo), who embraces open-source and reusability. Big fan of clean code and architecture design. Also an innovative UI/UX enthusiast  \n\n\nSchedule 6:30 PM Registration, mingling and snacks 7:00 PM The Talk 8:00 PM PIZZA, and more mingling","location":"Garena Office,  1 Fusionopolis Place, # 17-10, Galaxis Building, 138522, Singapore","rsvp_count":106,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Garena-Tech-Speak/events/235507191/","group_id":21118555,"group_name":"Garena Tech Speak","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Garena-Tech-Speak","formatted_time":"29 Nov 2016, Tue, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-11-29T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-11-29T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.299798,"longitude":103.78828},{"id":"235405373","name":"November Ruby Meetup","description":"Hi folks!  Join us for our next meetup, on the 29th of November 7pm at General Assembly.

Bring your laptop with a Java Virtual Machine installed (see https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup.html for version requirements). Windows, Linux and Mac should all work but we can best help with issues on Linux. All the other required software will be downloaded during the class.

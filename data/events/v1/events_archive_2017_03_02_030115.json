In this Meetup we will focus on running applications on Kubernetes. We'll start with a short introduction to Docker and container orchestration so participants without prior experience with container technologies can keep up. ","location":"Google Asia Pacific, 70, Pasir Panjang Road, #03-71, Mapletree Business City, Singapore 117371","rsvp_count":2,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Singapore/events/237867879/","group_id":20195727,"group_name":"Cloud Native Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Singapore","formatted_time":"02 Mar 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-02T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-02T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.276466,"longitude":103.798958}]}

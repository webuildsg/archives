Since “The Hacker's Diet” manual to manage weight loss through Excel sheets written by Autodesk founder John Walker (2005), the world of data-driven diets moved fast forward. This talk will discuss contemporary trends and issues in quantified diets on the example of the Soylent powdered foods community (http://www.soylent.com/). After the talk, we will play around with actual Soylent powders, try various products, and make our own DIY soylent recipes based on our personal dietary preferences. Would you like your powder made of vegan ingredients? Or a sustainable “locavore” Soylent version? A nootropic potion to keep you awake all night long? The Soylent powders and some DIY ingredients will be provided, but BYOStuff too!\n\nMarkéta Dolejšová is a food designer and researcher born in Prague; currently based in Singapore. In her work, she uses critical and speculative design methods to question techno-centric promises of digital food cultures and data-driven food lifestyles.  Markéta is also a PhD Candidate in the Communication and New Media at the National University of Singapore, where she writes about Design Research through Edible Speculation.\n\n#2 Talk title: Activities of BioHubIL, DIYbio community in Israel \nby Ilya Vainberg Slutskin (10 in)\n\nIlya Vainberg Slutskin is a PhD student in Weizmann Institute of Science and co-founder of BioHubIL[1][2][3]. BioHubIL is a non-profit organization aimed at making safe biological experimentation accessible to everyone. To this end, BioHubIL organizes meetups, biology courses, hands on activities and life science outreach events. In the long run, they aim to establish a community lab space to serve biohackers, artists, entrepreneurs, educators, students or anyone else interested in DIYbio. In this talk, Ilya will present some of the activities of BioHubIL.\n\n[1] https://www.facebook.com/groups/1725450001000736/\n[2] https://www.facebook.com/BioHubIL/?ref=bookmarks\n[3] http://biohubil.org\n\n#3 Talk title: YOU ARE THE RESISTANCE: Living as a holobiont in the Anthropocene. Genome. Microbiome. Hologenome? \nby Adeline Seah (10 min)\n\nThis talk will wander through evolution, gut health, social behaviour, extinction, and how, perhaps, the philosophy of immnuology could plunge you into an existential crisis or move you to be more than just a background actor in the story of the Anthropocene (happening right now in theaters everywhere). \n\nAdeline Seah (PhD) is a biologist exploring creative methods for wildlife conservation and outreach. Since 2012, she has collaborated on several turtle conservation projects in Cambodia and Myanmar. She is the founder of Biodiversity Connections, and also co-founder and festival director of the Singapore Eco Film Festival, held for the first time in Nov 2016 to engage and inspire people to make sustainable changes in their lives and to connect with organizations in the environmental sector.\n\n#4 Talk title: The BIONET: Building an open source decentralized wetware sneakernet. \nby Marc Juul (10 min)\n\nWhat are the major barriers to open collaboration in biology within the areas of wetware, software and lawware and how is the BioBricks Foundation providing solutions and workarounds + bonus update from Counter Culture Labs.","location":"HackerspaceSG, 344B King George's Avenue, King George's Building, Singapore 208576","rsvp_count":24,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/139410606619573","group_id":"189278128103","group_name":"HackerspaceSG","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/189278128103","formatted_time":"15 Jun 2017, Thu, 8:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-15T12:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-15T14:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.31023,"longitude":103.86252}]}

As an introduction to the ideas, Martin will explain how 'Style Transfer' works.   Taking it further, Sam will show his recent work on Super-Resolution (making CSI's \"enhance\" a reality). We've also got two confirmed \"Lightning Talks\" : One of which focuses on the architecture of the recently TPU devices from Google. As always, we're actively look for more speakers - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10). The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor. It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

Or social media memes that claim that drinking particular beverages will protect you from Dreaded Diseases? If we take a little bit of time to verify those claims we often find that they have no basis at all. \n\nIn this session, we will be exploring why we still share these \"fake news\" and why some of us believe them to be true. We will also build a truth-o-meter to help us verify these claims. \n\nIf you weren't able to join us before, this is a good time to come and catch ourselves up! This will also be when we begin to plan for our exhibition in May/June. If you will be joining us, please also bring your favorite \"fake claim\".\n\nAt the end of the series, the product we design will be exhibited in 2 HDB locations so we can share our insights.\n\nIf you care about civic education and the future of Singapore, start taking action today!","location":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2), 1 Tampines Street 73, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":1,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1028047717329530","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"12 May 2017, Fri, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2017-05-12T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-05-12T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.35782,"longitude":103.93187}]}

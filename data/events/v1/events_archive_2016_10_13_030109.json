After which she went on to join Ubisoft and worked on Ghost Recon Phantoms for years.\n\nShe believes that to start on game developing, one needs to learn to think like a game developer and move beyond a simple observation of a game being fun/not fun into a more analytical mindset of how one would go about making a great/fun title.\n\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _\nTECH BOLEH TAHAN is the rebooted series of informative talks and informal sharing sessions hosted by professionals in the technology, arts and design fields.

Limited capacity.\n\n\"... the history of battle is primarily the history of radically changing fields of perception.\" - Paul Virilio, War and Cinema: The Logistics of Perception\n\nIn the August edition of ArtScience Late, Ujikaiji presents Smokescreen featuring ecstatic new music by George Chua and visuals by Wu Jun Han. Inspired in part by contemporary strategies of war, speculative realism and cyberpunk, Smokescreen aims to be a hypersensory experience that elucidates the ways in which we experience war today. \n\nAbout Ujikaji\nUjikaji means “experiment” in Malay, and the independent music label’s interests lie in the curation of experimental music, with a special focus on Southeast Asian artists and sounds. The label supports a partnership with independent artists that allows them to focus on the creative aspects of music-making. \n\nAbout George Chua\nGeorge Chua is a sound artist and experimental musician based in Singapore. He currently uses the modular synth as a live performance tool. He aims to create electronic music free of the anxiety of influence, in which genre boundaries can be unclear, unnecessary and unpredictable. \nIn 2014, George began another chapter in his exploration of experimental forms and started phase two of his work after a five-year hiatus. His key focus is on creating music and dense sound structures based on his experiences of trance-like states. Apart from his solo work, his collaborative interests include live improvisation with sound, unconventional strategies for soundtracks and sound design for film and theatre. \n\nAbout Wu Jun Han\nWu Jun Han plays and performs in the audio-visual, expanded from a background in video art. He works with an interdisciplinary approach to performance, developed out of themes of the visceral, vernacular and the future. \nHe has performed extensively as a live visualist, playing live visual for music performances, ranging from improv and the avant-garde, to pop and punk bands. He also engages in an experimental music practice, based in improvisation, percussion and electronics.\n\nSponsored by Coca-Cola\n\n#ArtScienceLate #Ujikaji  #Smokescreen","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":167,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1236076369854669","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"17 Aug 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-17T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-17T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2862681050961,"longitude":103.85934988513}]}

The meetup requires all attendees to suggest ONE (1) topic with regards to \"Working in Multi-disciplinary teams\" at the point of event registration. We reserve the right to cancel your registration if the suggested topic is not contextually relevant.

He has been involved in web and desktop application development since the early days of Java. He is a true believer in open source and has participated on popular projects like Groovy, Griffon, and DbUnit, as well as starting his own projects (Json-lib, EZMorph, GraphicsBuilder, JideBuilder). He is a founding member of the Griffon framework and Hackergarten community event. \n\n\n\nTalk 1 - Java Libraries You Can’t Afford to Miss The Java language has passed its 20th anniversary, and with it comes an incredible range of tools libraries to choose from; sometimes there are actually too many choices for the same task. This presentation covers those libraries that have risen to the top, having proved themselves to be worthy of a place in every developer’s toolbox, for both production and testing code. It also discusses some fairly new libraries that are bound to make a big impact in the ecosystem.  \n\nTalk 2 - Testing Java Code Effectively The Java ecosystem has myriads of libraries and projects that can be used to create the features our customers require, there's no shortage of options everywhere you look when it comes to writing production code. But what about testing code? If you ascribe to the Clean Code ideals then you know that testing code is as important as production code. Luckily there are a good number of libraries that can be used with popular testing frameworks. In this session we'll discover how to write better parameterized tests; take care of concurrency related events; spy/mock/stub out collaborators to ensure cleaner and isolated tests; fake out REST APIs to test out client code; fake out REST clients to test out server code, and more.

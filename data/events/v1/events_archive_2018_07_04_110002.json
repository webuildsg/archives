These will be working sessions which can include: • DataJams where data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis, • Clinics for social sector organisations to drop in and ask data-related questions, and • Planning sessions for wider community events. Important to note • Unlike a normal meetup, if you sign up but don't show, you will be depriving our non-profit partners of other volunteers who can be there to help them. Please be considerate when you sign up, thank you. • It would be great if you bring your own water bottle along with your laptop and power cable too.

Talks for this month's event: 1. Kaz Sato, a Google Staff Developer Advocate - \"BigQuery and TensorFlow: Data Warehouse + Machine Learning enables the 'smart' query\" - BigQuery is Google's fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse. BigQuery's User Defined Function enables 'smart' queries with the power of machine learning, such as similarity search or recommendation on images or documents with feature vectors and neural network prediction. Kaz will demonstrate how BigQuery and TensorFlow enables a powerful \"data warehouse + ML\" solution. 2. Sara Robinson, Google Developer Advocate, will be presenting on the TensorFlow Object Detection API and how to serve a custom object detection iOS app she built to detect Taylor Swift. She'll cover everything from training a model with transfer learning to serving the model in the cloud, to making prediction requests to the model from an iOS device (in Swift!). 3. Kaggle TensorFlow Speech Recognition Winner: Heng Cher Keng will share his team winning experience in the TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge at Kaggle. For this talk, he will describe the use of \"knowledge distillation\" to fit a high accuracy (but big) ensemble of models to a single small TensorFlow model for implementation in Raspberry Pi3, with little loss in accuracy. 4. At the other end of the computation power spectrum : Chris Auld, who is speaking at FOSSASIA over the weekend, will give a quick overview of how he is using Keras, TensorFlow and the open source Horovod distributed computation platform (which is, according to their benchmarks, more efficient than the Distributed TensorFlow framework). --- Talks will start at 7pm (A/V equipment permitting) and end at around 9pm, at which point people normally come up to the front for a bit of a chat with each other, and the speakers. --- As always, we're actively looking for more speakers for future events - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks. For the lightning talks, we welcome folks to come and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (so, if you have slides, then #max=10). We believe that the key ingredient for the success of a Lightning Talk is simply the cool/interesting factor. It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

In this event, we have two sharing sessions (talk and Q+A). Session 1:\"Setting straight the coaching relationship in Agile coaching for power and ethics” by Giom .As Agile coach we deal with large organisation and often we get lost. Who’s my client? Who am I coaching? Who is judging the progress? Giom will share his experience of the coaching triangle, a concept that help him understand who to talk to and how. Or, sometimes, where did he fail. Session 2:\"10 ways worth-a-try, to convince your skeptical stakeholders to go along with you\" by Frederic Ducros.In this session, Frederic will share a few ways to likely fail (as he did), then a few mindsets, behaviors, and habits that may help you engage people who have so far doubted, steered away from, or outright opposed your efforts. About the Speaker: Giom (https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumeunlimited), a French national has been in Asia for more than two years. Currently he is based in Singapore as independent agile coach, trainer and facilitator. Before being agile coach, he developed his skills in software development. Frederic Ducros (https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericducros) is Agile/Lean organizational transformation coach, He helps executives and their teams excel in sales, delivery, transformation, product/solution design.

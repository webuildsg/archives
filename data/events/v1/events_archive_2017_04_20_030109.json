With adversaries becoming more sophisticated and carrying out advanced malware attacks, detecting, responding and investigating such intrusions becomes critical to infosec professionals. This presentation introduces you to the topic of memory forensics, it explains how to acquire a memory image, perform analysis using Volatility Framework and demos a few plugins that the speaker developed himself to aid his investigations. Title: DFIR on \"malicious\" powershell Title: Case study of poor planning One common reason for project failures is poor planning (lack of foresight). The speaker will use the illustration of a case study on how poor planning may have unintended consequences for the stakeholders Bio(s) of Speakers: Bart Inglot is an Incident Response and Forensics Specialist in MANDIANT's Security Consulting Services team helping clients restore confidence in an event of a breach.

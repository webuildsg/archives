Postscript: More Fun to Go (week 7 of the course) and the project from chapter 12 / week 6. This is the final chapter of the book / week of the course so we'll also have a recap on the book/course.  \"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed.\" Shimon Schocken, the author of the book talks about the course at TED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter and try out (better yet, complete) this week's course homework before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues! Book club is held at Tim &amp; Wei's residence: 244A Tanjong Katong RdSingapore  437032Singapore Doors open at 7:00, meetup starts at 7:30. Bring snacks and drinks of your choice!  FAQ Do I have to take Nand to Tetris Part I before taking Nand to Tetris Part II? From the Coursera course FAQ: \"Nand to Tetris Part I and Nand to Tetris Part II are two separate and stand alone courses. Although it is recommended to take Part I before taking Part II, you can take any of these courses, in any order that suites you.\" Feel free to ask questions in the SingaporeJS bookclub gitter room: https://gitter.im/SingaporeJS/discussions/bookclub Useful Links • NAND to Tetris website: http://www.nand2tetris.org/ • Get the book: http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ • Coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2","location":"Tim & Wei's Residence, 244A Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":8,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/238554854/","group_id":6363162,"group_name":"SingaporeJS","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-JS","formatted_time":"24 Apr 2017, Mon, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-24T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-24T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.30649,"longitude":103.895782}]}

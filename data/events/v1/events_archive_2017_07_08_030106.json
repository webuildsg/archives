For this first session, we will have Gerald Chin, a designer from Autodesk and a 3d print enthusiast with a keen interest in gadgets. He will share about his Project Hex in which Fusion 360 was used to design all aspects of “The Board”. It has made designing easier with the designing as it offers a history timeline and easy editing and creating numerous iterations for the project. Another major aspect of Fusion 360 used was the simulation feature. This offered a good visualization on where on the product had to be reinforced to take the load and the amount of pressure that it is designed to tolerate.  We welcome all to join us for this meetup and also share a bit of your projects too!  More about Project Hex Project Hex is the gamification of the mobility device with a touch of futuristic elements in the design and engineering concepts. The project has three components; The Arena, The Board and The Game.  The Arena is a dynamic platform that is able to generate various obstacles such as ramps, walls and slopes on the fly. This ever-evolving arena pushes the player’s extremes and creates an unpredictable and refreshing game play every time. The Arena provides a safe and conducive environment for users to push the limits of the sport and themselves. A virtual reality simulation of The Board and The Arena was created to bring the experience to life.  The Board is an omni-directional hoverboard that has a spherical drive system allowing it to achieve maximum maneuverability, providing it with the ability to transverse the obstacles in The Arena. With it’s unique hollowed-out design, The Board retains its strength but it is light at the same time.  The Game is the strategy game play the arena is built around. Two teams of three will compete against each other in a game of Capture the Flag in The Arena. The teams consist of the Overwatch, the Blocker and the Rider. The Overwatch will lead and direct the team strategy, while the blocker executes on the strategy by creating the obstacles and the rider focuses on capturing the flag.","location":"Funbie Studios, 70A Bussorah Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":11,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Autodesk-Fusion-360-Meetup/events/240736274/","group_id":24316487,"group_name":"Singapore | Autodesk Fusion 360 Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Autodesk-Fusion-360-Meetup","formatted_time":"08 Jul 2017, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-08T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-08T08:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.300898,"longitude":103.860031},{"id":"241395046","name":"FREE BUSINESS PREVIEW- HOW TO OWN A NEW TECHNOLOGY BIZ TO PROFIT PASSIVELY","description":"","location":"DORIS CHOONG, BLK 1003 INNO CENTRE, BT MERAH CENTRAL, Singapore","rsvp_count":1,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-dCWolvLB/events/241395046/","group_id":24870305,"group_name":"Singapore New Technology Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/meetup-group-dCWolvLB","formatted_time":"08 Jul 2017, Sat, 3:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-08T07:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-08T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.283684,"longitude":103.814041}]}

The new data.gov.sg, now in public beta, goes beyond being a data repository. It aims to make government data relevant and understandable to the public, through the active use of charts and articles. We will discuss the key features on the new data.gov.sg, such as real-time APIs, dashboards, data blog and the recently released developers portal. We will also share on our data quality guide, which will assist government agencies in converting their data from human-readable report formats into reusable, machine-readable formats. Speaker: Loh Li Wei is an associate consultant in IDA's Data Science Division, focusing on data-driven narratives and open data standards. He is part of a five-member team currently working on the new data.gov.sg portal.  Updates • TBC Join us on Facebook and Twitter  https://www.facebook.com/groups/pydatasg/ https://www.twitter.com/pydatasg  Sponsors     Group Sponsor ","location":"Skyscanner, 39 Robinson Road, #09-01 Robinson Point, Singapore 068911","rsvp_count":120,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/PyData-SG/events/229711618/","group_id":18509469,"group_name":"PyData Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/PyData-SG","formatted_time":"18 Oct 2016, Tue, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2016-10-18T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-18T12:45:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.279644,"longitude":103.849487},{"id":"234498120","name":"RegTech Connect!","description":"Regulatory technology aka RegTech (the new Fintech?) has the potential to be a real game-changer in the world of compliance and regulation.With a sector valuation at $100 billion, it's a good time for industry professionals to get together and share their thoughts on what is coming next.

Words like ‘information security’, ‘cyber security’ and ‘critical (information) infrastructure protection’ have found their way into many countries’ national security agenda over the past few years. When, how and why did that happen? Many countries have developed and published ‘National Cyber Security Strategies’ which outline how cyber threats are dealt with at the national level. Everyone is facing the same threats in cyberspace, yet we are all approaching it differently. Why? My talk is not a linear narration of history. My talk aims to explore and explain this phenomenon, from a policy analysis angle, of how ‘cyber security’ became a national security issue and what impact this has on the future. Speaker : Sanoop Thomas  Topic      : Abusing TARGET attribute   Abstract : This session talks about abusing an interesting html attribute that could be a potential plot for information leakage and other social engineering attacks. This issue is already known, reported and most of the times ignored to fix by developers due to lack of awareness about the threat landscape. The session demonstrate how this can be exploited and the mitigation techniques to avoid such issues in web applications.  ","location":"Microsoft, Microsoft Singapore 1 Marina Boulevard","rsvp_count":58,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community/events/234853313/","group_id":18493025,"group_name":"Null Singapore - The Open Security Community","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Null-Singapore-The-Open-Security-Community","formatted_time":"18 Oct 2016, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-10-18T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-18T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.28222,"longitude":103.852768},{"id":"234753343","name":"Science Hack Day Pre-Event and Pitch Preparation","description":"Let's get together and prepare for an amazing Science Hack Day in Singapore!

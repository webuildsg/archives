The methodology has been used in all aspects of research and development, from understanding the biological mechanisms of diseases to research and development of novel small molecule and biotherapeutic drugs. Here we will provide experimental data collected in collaboration with global institutions that will provide insight into the use of this technology in (1) cytokine profiling, biomarker detection assays associated with inflammation, and immune response and repair, (2) screening method for determining inhibitory molecular effects of PD-1 and PD-L1 binding, (3) cell signalling and signal transduction method that directly measures endogenous levels of phosphorylated cellular proteins and secondary messengers in cell and tissue lysates, (4) epigenetic enzymatic assay for readers, writers, and erasers that enable characterisation of multiple target and (5) experimental workflow solutions for 2D and 3D cell culture models.\nAlpha technology is a unique homogenous bead-based method developed for applications such as (1) detection and quantification of molecular targets in a variety of sample backgrounds, including biomarkers in serum and plasma, intracellular and membrane-bound proteins in cell lysates, or secreted proteins in cell supernatants; (2) measurement of protein-protein interactions, including large multi-subunit complexes; (3) measurement of various enzyme activities, in particular those leading to post-translational protein modifications such as phosphorylation and epigenetic modifications (4) detection and titration of full sized viral phage particles (5) fundamental and applied immunological research and development, particularly its use in biotherapeutic antibodies detection and characterisation (6) biotechnology applications for antibody screening and process analytics – i.e. purity assessment of biotherapeutics, and (7) immunogenicity assays for quantification of anti-drug antibodies in pre-clinical and clinical studies.\nThe methods offer high versatility in assay design and can be used to study nearly any biological interaction using small and large molecules, and binding partners of greatly disparate size thus can be applied and customised in many biochemical or cell based experimental designs.\nDr Margareta Sutijia’s BiographyDr. Margareta Sutija has a PhD in biology (molecular biology) & currently holds the position of Business leader for Research reagents, Instruments and Applications for the Asia Pacific region at PerkinElmer.She has seven years of research experience at PhD and postdoctoral level in molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, stem cell biology, cell culture, cancer biology, assay development and biochemistry. After which, she spent a number of years as Application Scientist for technology development associated with drug discovery and biotherapeutics research and development. Here she established and developed a number of collaborations with leading academic research institutions which lead to commercialized market products.","location":"IMCB, 61 Biopolis Drive, #03-46, Singapore 138673","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/join-us-for-a-seminar-with-perkinelmer-tickets-37935181148?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11108961173","group_name":"PerkinElmer Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/perkinelmer-singapore-11108961173","formatted_time":"26 Sep 2017, Tue, 4:00 pm","start_time":"2017-09-26T08:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-26T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"243302233","name":"RubySG Meetup (September)","description":"Hi fellow Rubyists!

I will walk through an end-to-end process, from coding an app using Kivy library to deploying the same app to iOS and Android devices using Kivy toolchains. Chao-Jen Chen is a university instructor teaching Calculus, Probability, and Linear Algebra. He used to work in the finance industry as fixed income quantitative analyst and FX manager, managing and hedging USD3bn FX exposure to more than 20 currencies. His personal research interest is Singapore’s monetary policy tool, i.e., the SGD NEER (Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange Rate). In April 2017, he released an app in Google Play and Apple App Store that implemented his SGD NEER model. He also wrote a chapter on numerical computing in finance for a book (F# Deep Dives, published by Manning Publications Co. in December, 2014).  8:00pm: Welcome to async/await by Dima Tisnek Dima will present the paradigm of async/await across a few languages (Python3.6 and ES2017) with some live coding.","location":"Carousell @ Keppel Towers 2, 240 Tanjong Pagar Road #12-00, Singapore","rsvp_count":100,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/240954690/","group_id":18417697,"group_name":"Singapore Python User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group","formatted_time":"26 Sep 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-09-26T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-26T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.275604,"longitude":103.842606}]}

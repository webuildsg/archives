We will be going through beginner level models and how they work.  The goal is to take you from nothing very little about Deep Learning to having an understanding about how it works and how to use it to build models for yourself. You need to have a decent understanding of code - specifically be able to follow along with code examples, and modify/enhance them on your own laptop.  That means you MUST BRING A LAPTOP (including power adapter). We will be using Python throughout the day.  If you are new to Python we suggest you watch this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA We've put the MeetUp start time at 9:30am, as we have a lot to go through in the day. We've had to charge something for the event, because (a) we need to make sure people will come if they sign up; and (b) the location costs money.","location":"Padang & Co, LEVEL3, #03-22/24, 20 Pasir Panjang Rd, Mapletree Business City, Singapore 117439","rsvp_count":2,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore/events/240635858/","group_id":21982556,"group_name":"TensorFlow and Deep Learning Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/TensorFlow-and-Deep-Learning-Singapore","formatted_time":"24 Jun 2017, Sat, 9:30 am","start_time":"2017-06-24T01:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-24T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.275339,"longitude":103.79911},{"id":"450318962001698","name":"Design Build Code : Hackathon for Kids","description":"Explore the Possibilities of Technology and Design\nJoin us for our inaugural kids' hackathon at National Design Centre!

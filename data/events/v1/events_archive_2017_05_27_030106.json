Registration on Level 4.\n\nAs part of the opening programme of HUMAN+ - The Future of Our Species, two of the pioneers of art and technology will come together for one afternoon of riveting presentations and discussions at ArtScience Museum. Stelarc is one of the true legends of art and technology performance. Three of his recent performance artworks are exhibited as part of HUMAN+. Steve Dixon is President of LASALLE College of the Arts in Singapore, and a world-renowned scholar of technology in performance. \n\nIn this age of gene mapping, body hacking, gender reassignment, neural implants, face transplants, prosthetic augmentation, turbine hearts and organ printing, these distinguished speakers will show us a rapidly approaching future where what a body is and how it operates becomes problematic; where technology is what defines the meaning of being human, and is part of being human.\n\n‘HUMAN+ AND THE AESTHETICS OF CYBERNETIC-EXISTENTIALISM’ BY STEVE DIXON\nSteve Dixon takes a lively look at artists who explore themes of Cybernetic-Existentialism in their practice, in the light of emerging themes within contemporary arts and performance that appear to relate simultaneously to both fields and to fuse them.\n\nABOUT STEVE DIXON\nProf Steve Dixon is an internationally recognised academic, researcher and interdisciplinary artist with a distinguished career in both higher education leadership and the professional creative industries. He joined LASALLE College of the Arts as its sixth President in February 2012.\n\nFollowing a successful career as an actor and award-winning director of film and digital media productions, Steve became an academic in 1991. He quickly established an international reputation for his research in the use of media and computing technologies in the performing arts.\n\nHis seminal, 800 page book, Digital Performance is recognised as the most comprehensive scholarly work on the subject and won international awards including the Association of American Publishers Award for Excellence in Music and the Performing Arts.\n\nHe has an accomplished record as a strategic and visionary leader. Prior to LASALLE he was Head of the School of Arts, then Pro Vice Chancellor at Brunel University, London.\n\n‘ALTERNATE ANATOMICAL ARCHITECTURES: CREEPY, UNCANNY AND CONTESTABLE BODIES’ BY STELARC\nFor the past four decades, Stelarc has interrogated the aesthetics, the ethics, and the engineering of robotics, virtual systems and biotechnology to explore alternate interfaces with the human body, generating concepts of the future that can be contested, critically examined and possibly appropriated. Stelarc will give a lecture about his work, which forms a key part of the exhibition, HUMAN+.\n\nABOUT STELARC\nStelarc explores alternate anatomical architectures, interrogating issues of agency, identity and the posthuman. He has performed with a Third Hand, a Stomach Sculpture and Exoskeleton, a six-legged walking robot. Fractal Flesh, Ping Body and Parasite are internet performances that explore remote and involuntary choreography. He is surgically constructing and stem-cell growing an ear on his arm that will be internet enabled. In 1996 he was made an Honorary Professor of Art and Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh and in 2002 was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by Monash University, Melbourne. In 2010 was awarded the Ars Electronica Hybrid Arts Prize. In 2015 he received the Australia Council’s Emerging and Experimental Arts Award. In 2016 he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the Ionian University, Corfu. Stelarc is currently a Distinguished Research Fellow, School of Design and Art, Curtin University. His artwork is represented by Scott Livesey Galleries, Melbourne. \n\nThree of Stelarc’s recent performance artworks are presented in HUMAN+: Propel: Body on Robot Arm (2015), Rewired / Remixed: Event for Dismembered Body (2016), and Stickman (2017). Also on show is documentation of the Extra Ear project, made by artist Nina Sellars.\n\nPresented in partnership with LASALLE College of the Arts and Curtin University.\n\nStelarc #ArtScienceMuseum","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":119,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1975202866047103","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"27 May 2017, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2017-05-27T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-05-27T07:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2862813727839,"longitude":103.85942840826},{"id":"1692968541007273","name":"Tech Saturday Season 3 Week 7","description":"Learn about urban farming while building your own rooftop farm!","location":"Community Lab at United World College SEA, 1 Tampines Street 73, #01-D119, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":3,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1692968541007273","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"27 May 2017, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2017-05-27T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-05-27T10:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.35782,"longitude":103.93187}]}

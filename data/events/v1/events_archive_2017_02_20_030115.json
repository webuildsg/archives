That’s over 10 years of Tweets back to 2006. It’s also hundreds of millions of new Tweets rolling in every single day. So, as a marketer or data scientist, what would you do with access to the world's largest archive of human thought that has ever existed? #TwitterDATA Meetup will bring together data scientists, analytics experts, marketing and IT leaders for an evening of inspiration on the power of social data. The event will be hosted at Twitter Singapore, where you will hear from Twitter Data’s Head of Data Science, Dr. Scott Hendrickson (@drskippy), who leads a team of data scientists and strategists working with some of the biggest companies in the world and Ben Truscello (@bentruscello), Head of Global Brands &amp; Agencies for Twitter Data. The session will also include a panel discussion with local data science experts, practitioners, and leaders who will share their experiences in working in the field of data science. (Details will be provided soon!) Plan to stick around for networking!

The focus of the talk will be on conversion of documents (versus images of scenery with text), and will also cover certain ways we can improve the results obtained from Tesseract. We will be using tesserocr, a Python wrapper for Tesseract API, to achieve OCR the Pythonic way.  Oswell Chan is a recent Computer Science graduate from NUS and works as a Software Developer at Acronis. His interest lies in automation, with a focus to streamline mundane tasks in daily life. His first exposure to OCR was triggered by the problem of trying to ease bill splitting between a big group. Deep Learning with Python &amp; TensorFlow: Python has lots of scientific, data analysis, and machine learning libraries. But there are many problems when starting out on a machine learning project. Which library do you use? How can you use a model that has been trained in your production app? In this talk I will discuss how you can use TensorFlow to create Deep Learning applications and how to deploy them into production. Ian Lewis is a Developer Advocate for Google Cloud Platform based Tokyo, Japan. Ian is a Python and Go developer who is passionate about developer communities. He previously co-founded PyCon JP, the largest Python event in Japan.

So knitting is inherently binary, and that opens up a world of possibilities for a coder. Knitted fabric can be used to encode data in a number of ways, from QR code mittens to a fluffy red virus scarf. Patterns themselves become algorithms, and new syntax proposals allow for automated testing, compilers, and even visualisers. Crafters and programmers are working together in the burgeoning Maker scene to hack hardware, create innovative e-textiles, and push the computational limits of sticks and string.\n\nJoin us in the evening for the most enriching and inspiring talk by Kristine Howard.

Chat with our bot to find out where you stand on the meritocracy vs privilege scale and see how you compare with your peers. &gt;&gt;START HERE&lt;&lt; WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON THIS WEEK Need help to convert secondary schools JSON data into usable CSVs Sort secondary school rankings into a CSV so we can create PSLE cut-off points Finalise the final data for input into the calculator and transform into JSON file if need be Start on skeleton of the project if possible - need coders Designers welcome to start mocking up, creating styles PROJECT BACKGROUND Singapore prides itself on being a meritocratic society where one can get ahead in life based on their efforts, not their inherited privilege. Yet, the process to get into the first stage of education, primary schools, is through a system of phases which can depend entirely on your parents’ connections and background. This may or may not have a domino-like effect on the chances for the student as they progress through their education as certain schools are better equipped and have better connections - all the way through to university and beyond. The aim is to get the conversation started for Singaporeans today by challenging their preconceived opinions of their own progress through life. In essence, it will be a 'privilege calculator' where you can measure where you stand on the scale: Meritocracy or Parentocracy. More specifically, it can help the reader to calculate - via proxy indicators - to what extent they have made use of socio-economic privileges passed down from your parents or family or connections versus to what extent you have either: Not used this privileges and instead got to where you were on your own ORNot had access to these privileges UPDATES VIA SLACK: https://hhsg-slack.herokuapp.com/ TRELLO BOARD: https://trello.com/invite/b/wDIl5vep/6347f978659531692bee1cb22db12396/hhsg-build GITHUB: https://github.com/HHSG/privilegecalculator GOOGLE DRIVE: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxBGozlxM_ZEUzRxajVoZ0dSQkU?usp=sharing  WHAT IS HHSG BUILD? It is Hacks/Hackers Singapore's (HHSG) weekly hands on session for those who are willing to spare a few precious weekend hours to create a data-driven or interactive journalism project. We are willing to work on anything but since it will be on a voluntary basis, the ideas must be of social or learning value. The final project may or may not be published but everything we work on will adhere to open source and open data principals.","location":"ST Innovation Lab - SPH, 1000 Toa Payoh North, Singapore","rsvp_count":8,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Singapore/events/240501245/","group_id":18589883,"group_name":"Hacks/Hackers Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Hacks-Hackers-Singapore","formatted_time":"10 Jun 2017, Sat, 12:30 pm","start_time":"2017-06-10T04:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-10T07:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.342616,"longitude":103.848419},{"id":"453611404983608","name":"Cosmology in Maths and Art","description":"Get inspired by geometrical designs from some of the most famous and beautiful Islamic architecture and art including the Great Mosque of Cordoba, Spain, the Qarawiyyin Mosque of Morroco, the Huand Hatun Complex of Turkey and more to kickstart your journey to master this ancient medieval art.

Register in the lobby.\n\nHumanity has always sought to catalogue the heavens and make visible the invisible forces we yearn to understand. Virtually every culture known to anthropology has had a cosmology – a story of how the world began and continues, a fundamental sense of how its members came to exist, and an attempt to grasp its place in it and how its narrative fits into some larger picture. \nTurn your imagination to the cosmos at this Conversations programme and explore the universe through the lenses of art, cultural history, philosophy and science, held in conjunction with the opening of The Universe and Art as part of the Art and Science of Space season. The programme unfolds across a series of talks that investigates cosmology from different perspectives, looking at how we seek to understand and depict the universe.\n\nSpeakers include Honor Harger (Executive Director of ArtScience Museum), Nanjo Fumio (Director of Mori Art Museum), Tsubaki Reiko (Associate Curator at Mori Art Museum), Berlin-based artist Björn Dahlem, Slovenian theatre director Dragan Živadinov, Conan Cheong (Assistant Curator for Cross-Cultural Art at Asian Civilisations Museum), Yeow Kai Chai (Poet and Director of Singapore Writers Festival) and Lee Wei Fen (Associate Vice President, Ethnography at Quantum Singapore). \n\n#ASMuniverseandart\n\nProgramme schedule\n2:00 – 2:05 Intro by ArtScience Museum \n2:05 – 2:15 Welcome note by Honor Harger, Executive Director of ArtScience Museum\n2:15 – 2.25 Overview of The Universe and Art by Nanjo Fumio, Director of Mori Art Museum\n2:25 – 2:40 Models of the cosmos and reimagining the ways the universe is understood, by artist Björn Dahlem\n2:40 – 2:55 Devising choreography and theatre for the micro-gravity of space by Dragan Živadinov, Theatre director and artist\n2:55 – 3:10 Q&A with Nanjo Fumio, Björn Dahlem and Dragan Živadinov, moderated by Honor Harger\n3:10 – 3:25 Break\n3:25 – 3:35 Welcome back note by Lee Wei Fen, Associate Vice President, Ethnography at Quantum Singapore\n3:35 – 3:50 How humanity views, imagines and constructs understanding of the cosmos through highlights from The Universe and Art by Tsubaki Reiko, Associate Curator at Mori Art Museum\n3:50 – 4:05 Cultural perspectives in cosmology across the centuries by Conan Cheong, Assistant Curator for Cross-Cultural Art at Asian Civilisations Museum\n4:05 – 4:20 When the literary imagination meets the universe\nby Yeow Kai Chai, Poet and Director of Singapore Writers Festival\n4:20 – 4:35 Q&A with Tsubaki Reiko, Conan Cheong and Yeow Kai Chai, moderated by Lee Wei Fen\n4:35 – 4:40 Outro by ArtScience Museum","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":304,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1822872327986250","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"01 Apr 2017, Sat, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-01T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-01T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2862813727839,"longitude":103.85942840826}]}

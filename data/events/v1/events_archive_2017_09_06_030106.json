Please register at the link below and go to the venue directly before 6.30pm on 6 Sep Wednesday. Registration: https://goo.gl/wRzxvq­ RSK Labs (aka Rootstock) has created the first Smart Contracts platform secured by the Bitcoin Network fully compatible with Ethereum. Recently RSK Labs has also designed Lumino, an offchainpayment network similar to the Lightning Network. Together with a new onchain compression protocol can provide a game-changing scaling solution that can process up to[masked] transactions per second solving bitcoin's transaction capacity problem. These technologies provide a major boost in efficiency of retail and P2P transactions, especially those involving micropayments. The new breakthrough arrived just a few weeks after the first implementation of scaling solution Segregated Witness (SegWit) was deployed as a soft fork in the Litecoin network, and later on August 24, has also been activated on the Bitcoin network. Concurrently, there are plans to implement SegWit2x which would eventually introduce a hard fork in the Bitcoin blockchain on late November. Ethereum has also recently introduced Plasma, a scaling infrastructure for the Ethereum blockchain, and there is also PeaceRelay, to be maintained and developed by Kyber Network, that enables two-way relay between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, or basically any Ethereum-based blockchain.

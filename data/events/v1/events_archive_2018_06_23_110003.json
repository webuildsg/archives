They do this by running the application inside a virtualized operating system. However as your fleet of containers grow, you’ll find that managing them becomes a chore.\nKubernetes is container orchestration platform for managing containers; it performs tasks like restarting containers if they die, route request to appropriate application, migrate persistent volumes, schedule rolling updates, etc.\nThis workshop is broken into 2 segments; in the first segment, we will build a simple application and illustrate how to containerize that application.\nThe second part of this workshop, will focus on how to use Kubernetes to deploy and manage the application.\n\n*Stay in touch  with the latest from us!

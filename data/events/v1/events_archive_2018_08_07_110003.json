Partnered with Hypernet We are moving into a future where control and ownership of data is being reimagined. This gives rise to new technology and services that are in their very nature decentralized. By extension, the decentralization of data (whether it is from IoT devices, self-driving vehicles, or user computer interactions) will become a reality. However, data by itself is useless. It is the intelligence that is derived from data that is valuable. Computing is required to extract that intelligence, but today, computing on decentralized networks is broken. The Hypernet team have been creating solutions, based on a new parallel programming model, for computing on decentralized networks and allow insights to be pulled out of large decentralized data stores in a privacy preserving manner. Through the use of infrastructure technology like Hypernet, we can realize the value in decentralized data and unlock the potential of the coming wave of technology innovations. Date : 7 August 2018, TuesdayTime : 5:30pm – 7:30pmVenue : 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore 059911 Programme:5:30pm – 6:00pm: Registration6:00pm – 7:00pm: Data Analytics and Blockchain in the Decentralized Future7:00pm – 7:30pm: Q&amp;A and End Speakers:Hypernet was founded by a passionate team of 3 individuals - Ivan Ravlich, Todd Chapman and Daniel Maren, who met in the early 2010’s while studying at Stanford. IVAN RAVLICH - He is a problem solver at heart, and he bridges the divide between multiple tech disciplines that are often siloed and cut off from each other: chemical engineering, materials science, aerospace engineering, and theoretical physics. Through his involvement in several cutting-edge technology startups—working with everything from biofuels to plasma rockets—he has firsthand knowledge of the challenges that face creators of emerging technologies. These multidisciplinary endeavors also helped shape his “beyond borders” world view. Through his leadership, Hypernet will be able to overcome any obstacles thrown its way. TODD CHAPMAN - He lives and breathes parallel computing methods. He created the decentralized computing architecture atop which high performance computing applications can be deployed, running on a heterogeneous, dynamic, and scalable network of devices. Todd’s PhD research at Stanford facilitated his discovery of the deep truths of applied mathematics that undergird this structure. He leads the technical team with his vision for the overall architecture of Hypernet. DANIEL MAREN - He is a serial entrepreneur who got his start studying computer science at Stanford. He left full-time studies to form a solar company that was later acquired by SunPower. He contributes operations and business development skills that he developed by founding startups and working and consulting for large corporations.","location":"SGInnovate, 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":38,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/SGInnovate/events/253118334/","group_id":26743667,"group_name":"SGInnovate","group_url":"http://meetup.com/SGInnovate","formatted_time":"07 Aug 2018, Tue, 5:30 pm","start_time":"2018-08-07T09:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-08-07T11:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.288118,"longitude":103.847542},{"id":"253334006","name":"Building GraphQL APIs with Hasura","description":"In this API Craft Singapore Meetup, you will learn about building GraphQL APIs instantly with https://hasura.io! We will start with a basic introduction to GraphQL, and will also discuss the advantages of GraphQL vis-a-vis REST. --- Talk details --- The Hasura GraphQL engine is an open source GraphQL server that gives you GraphQL APIs instantly over any Postgres database. In this talk, we'll go over the design and architecture of this high-performance, low-footprint engine. For example, on Heroku's free tier with the free postgres addon, you can get query throughputs in excess of a 1000 reqs/sec at around ~50MB of RAM. We will take you over how to set Hasura up with your existing Postgres applications, including authentication and authorization, so that you can start using GraphQL from your apps without writing backend code. --- Speaker Bio --- Tanmai is the co-founder of hasura.io. He is a StackOverflow powered fullstack, polyglot developer whose areas of interest and work span react, nodejs, python, haskell, docker, postgres, kubernetes. He is passionate about making the power of building things accessible to everyone and is the instructor of India's largest MOOC imad.tech with over 250,000 students. You will occasionally see him speaking, or more often being quietly awkward, at conferences and meetups. He has spoken at a number of international tech conferences such as Reactathon 2018, and KubeCon 2018. --- Programme --- 6:00pm: Doors open - mingle over food and drinks 6:20pm: Start of session, opening address by hosts 6.30pm: Talk: Building GraphQL APIs with Hasura 8:00pm: Community announcements / Further networking over drinks --- Getting here --- This meetup will be at WeWork's Beach Centre at 15 Beach Road, Singapore[masked].

It aims to be the next utility and settlement payment system for digital currencies. TOS coin itself is a means of payment with high transaction speed. However, TOS coin may face volatility if it is introduced in the market (exchange), just as existing digital currencies. That is why TOS payment system has adopted TOSP (Payable TOS) coin which is a private coin with unchangeable value in the whole payment process of “payment → settlement → purchase → exchange (selling)”. By adopting TOSP, the value of TOS will be maintained at the same level at the selling and purchasing point.TOSP coin is only used in the internal process of TOS payment system, not traded in exchanges. Thus, TOSP coin is free from volatility that may occur in transactions. Customers can purchase TOSP coin to use TOS payment system only in designated TOS exchanges and business owners can convert TOSP to TOS coin or to cash only in designated TOS exchanges.

Advances in digital technologies have enhanced the capabilities of surgical practitioners in significant ways. With each advance, the relationship between human operators and digital assistants becomes ever more inter-dependent and intertwined. Tim worked closely with product developers and surgical practitioners to understand the opportunities for enhancing the patient and surgeon experience, and to consider new ways to support interactions with the control system when physical (touch) interactions were not possible. Through in-theatre observations during operations and interviews with surgeons, radiographers and support staff, he used principles of user-centred design to optimise the overlay and data visualisation system in the context of the operating theatre. Join us for a session that discusses how we can apply solid experience design methods in new environments by learning new nomenclatures, taxonomies and relationships to make sense of human interactions in extraordinary contexts. - About the speaker Tim is a Principal Designer at Foolproof, meaning that he’s responsible for the integrity of the thinking behind Foolproof’s experience design practice. Tim works closely with design, strategy and insight teams, and with business stakeholders and third parties, to create evidence-based designs for global brands such as Sage, Simply Health, Coke, Apple, Sky, HSBC and Shell. As principal designer, he is focused on understanding user needs and behaviours, contexts of use, and interactions with information systems, to do smart things for good people. - Recommended attendees This event is recommended for design enthusiasts who are interested to apply experience design methodologies in various contexts. Healthcare professionals are also invited to explore how user-centred design can be applied in medical settings. - Ticketing This is a free event and all are welcomed to join. - Venue We are in the process of booking the venue for the event. We will update the Meetup page once the venue is confirmed.

Description: Media consumption has changed radically, and today mobile is moving at light speed and catalysing business innovation and transformation around the world. The MMA Singapore Forum 2017 will focus on how mobile is being redefined – on the radical, transformational, pervasive changes in the ways companies market and sell their products and services. More than a communications channel, more than a device, mobile is the ultimate disruptor and the gateway through which many consumers experience a brand. It’s also a mechanism that allows brands to understand and connect with consumers in ways never before possible.

The 0x protocol will act as a critical piece of infrastructure for the token economy, allowing Ethereum smart contracts to programmatically and seamlessly exchange Ethereum-based assets. This decentralized protocol will be key in enhancing the interoperability of assets so that dapps can autonomously trade, and more importantly access and utilize, the entire landscape of Ethereum tokens natively (imagine being in Status.im chat and you want more info on another person; by sending a request in Status.im, you could autonomously access Uport's ID database, and even pay users tokens to feed their personal data back to you via Status). It's an ambitious project, and one we're excited to have the Ethereum community learn more about.  \n\n\nOrganizers:  \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVenue Sponsor: ","location":"SGInnovate, 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":98,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore/events/240603424/","group_id":18519858,"group_name":"Ethereum Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Ethereum-Singapore","formatted_time":"09 Jun 2017, Fri, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2017-06-09T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-09T12:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.288118,"longitude":103.847542}]}

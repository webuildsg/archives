These will be working sessions which can include:  • DataJams where data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis,  • Clinics for social sector organisations to drop in and ask data-related questions, and • Planning sessions for wider community events.  This time, we're ramping up for a DataDive on the weekend of March 24-26! This is a closed, by-invitation only session for volunteers whom we've worked with before. If we've forgotten you (sorry!) or you're new and have a burning desire to join these sessions, please send us a message! For others who can't make it regularly, these sessions are helping us have more community-wide events. Please understand that no food will be provided, so do make preparations to grab a bite before you turn up. Also, it would be great if you bring your own water bottle along with your laptop and power cable too.

With today’s emphasis on speed and instant gratification, many woodworkers have jumped straight into using expensive power tools when using a hand tool could be a much cheaper, quicker and satisfying option.\n\nIn this introductory class to the Woodworking Basics for Adults course, we will be taking a skills-based approach to learning woodworking and will be making a beautiful wooden spatula for you to bring home. In support of sustainability, we will be using pine & kapor wood offcuts as our base material.\n\n- Improve your knowledge of wood and learn where to find tools and wood sources in Singapore;\n- Use woodworking hand tools (chisels, spokeshaves, hand drills) with precision\n- Listen to your inner artist and develop a feel for woodworking\n- Make a wooden spatula\n\nClasses begin with a minimum of 3 people (max 6). This introductory class is the starting point to becoming a hobbyist woodworker. The full woodcraft course comprises 4 modules.","location":"Community Lab at United World College SEA, 1 Tampines Street 73, #01-D119, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":0,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/799869130167191","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"01 Mar 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-01T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-01T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.35782,"longitude":103.93187},{"id":"237042008","name":"First 2017 Meetup","description":"Our very first meetup for 2017 confirmed topics: [masked] nodejs with zookeeper [masked] using terraform - infrastructure as code [masked] swagger for rapid rest api development Open mic session &amp; post meetup activity note: topic vue + framework7 will be ready in the next meetup","location":"22CF12, Level 22, Microsoft Singapore, Singapore 018989, One Marina Boulevard","rsvp_count":70,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Full-Stack-Developer/events/237042008/","group_id":19593085,"group_name":"Singapore Full Stack Developer","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Full-Stack-Developer","formatted_time":"01 Mar 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-01T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-01T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.282387,"longitude":103.85244},{"id":"237723906","name":"Hackware v2.8","description":"1.

When he's not writing immense walls of code he's writing immense walls of code.\n\nBradley was the kid that was always pulling things apart and (sometimes) putting them back together again. After studying psychology and medicine, and realising neither floated his boat, Bradley found his calling in the world of technology.\n\nQuite obviously a natural, starting TradeGecko was his chance to utilize all of his technical and creative skills, building market-leading software from the ground up. He now leads an ever growing team of talented developers and designers helping drive the shared mission of creating the effortless inventory and order management platform that the world transacts upon.\n\nAbout TradeGecko\n\nTradeGecko was founded in February 2012, by three entrepreneurs from New Zealand – brothers Cameron and Bradley Priest along with Carl Thompson. The founders saw an opportunity in Southeast Asia and moved to Singapore to be incubated by technology accelerator, JFDI. Previously running businesses ranging from retail apparel to web design, TradeGecko was born out of a frustration to efficiently manage and track retail inventory and warehouse administration. After quick market uptake of the initial TradeGecko solution and after securing significant early-stage funding, TradeGecko’s adoption grew rapidly amongst online retailers and wholesalers. TradeGecko is now the most intuitive, technology-driven cloud solution serving a global customer base in over 100 countries and making wholesale transactions as easy as shopping on Amazon.\n\nTradeGecko have raised over USD 12M from world-class investors, including; The National Research Foundation of Singapore, Golden Gate Ventures, Wave Maker Labs, Jungle Ventures, 500 Startups and NSI Ventures.","location":"General Assembly, Level 3, 8 Claymore Hill, Space Mob, Singapore 229572","rsvp_count":27,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1654853621246844","group_id":711704195596196,"group_name":"General Assembly Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/711704195596196","formatted_time":"07 Sep 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-09-07T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-07T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.30781,"longitude":103.8318199},{"id":"242913309","name":"WordPress Meetup (September 2017)","description":"Lightning Talk: Amazon Lightsail Hosting for WordPressSpeaker: Lillian So, AWS Talk 1: How we built walkabout.sg with WordPress (from a non-technical perspective)  Speaker: Kristine Lauria, Walkabout.sg  Talk 2: How to Outsource like a Boss Speaker: Paul Luxford, WPGeni.com And if we get more time -  Open Q&amp;A: Please comment (below) on topics you would like to discuss, experts &amp; enthusiasts present will answer questions.

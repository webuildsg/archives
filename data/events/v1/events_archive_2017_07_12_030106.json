K. Vishwakarma, Founder, CEO of AllThingsConnected.\n\nSpeakers Bio:\nSimon NgSimon brings with him nearly 20 years of engineering software industry experience; 15 years of which have been spent at Autodesk Malaysia, Singapore and Japan, where he held various technical, industry marketing and sales management positions from 1999 to 2013. He left on a 2.5 years hiatus to lead Lexmark Malaysia and rejoined Autodesk family in his current role in early 2016. An Engineer by training, Simon started his career at Parametric Technology Corporation (PTC) after graduating with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Malaya and trained in Manufacturing Engineering under Association of Overseas Technical Scholarship in Yokohama Kenshu Center, Japan. He also holds a Masters in International Management from RMIT University in Australia. He is based in Malaysia and speaks English, Chinese, Malay and Japanese. \n\nAssistant Professor Pham Quang CuongCuong was born in Hanoi, Vietnam and grew up in Vietnam and then in France. He graduated from École Normale Supérieure rue d'Ulm, France, in 2007. He obtained a PhD in Neuroscience from Université Paris VI and Collège de France in 2009. In 2010, he was a Visiting Researcher at the University of São Paulo, Brazil. From 2011 to 2013, he was as a Fellow of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), studying Robotics at the University of Tokyo. He joined NTU as an Assistant Professor in 2013. He was the recipient of the Best Paper Award at the conference Robotics: Science and Systems, 2012. His team won the second prize at the Airbus Shopfloor Challenge at ICRA 2016.\n\nC.

Some of these changes are setting new directions of how products are being designed, made and used, to buildings and infrastructure being manufactured. Simon will share key technologies that are highlighted from Gartner's Hype Cycle. This Hype Cycle specifically focuses on the set of technologies that is showing promise in delivering a high degree of competitive advantage over the next five to ten years. We will explore and discuss various new technology predictions that will change our lives as well as discussing case studies of product as a service model, from ownership to access.\n\nRobotics has largely contributed to increasing industrial productivity by automating many tedious or dangerous tasks, such as pick-and-place, welding, painting. The common points of these tasks are (i) they involve little contact interaction, (ii) they take place in highly structured environments, such as assembly lines. By contrast, tasks involving significant contact interactions and taking place in unstructured environments have so far resisted robotic automation. Addressing these challenges is therefore essential for the next generation of factory automation, which is bound to change the game in worldwide manufacturing. In this talk, Cuong will discuss how our group has been addressing these challenges by leveraging the most recent breakthroughs in AI and robotics.\n\nIn the age of exponential development in technologies, value creation remains the best metrics to define the impact of technologies in an industry. To achieve breakthrough growth in the future, while organisations need to make bold and disruptive moves, they have to take a phase wise approach understanding the risk and challenges. In this session CK will share his experienced approach with some real use cases, how an organization can be successful or may fail.\n\n","location":"SGInnovate, 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore 059911","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/ai-eveningsginnovate-manufacturing-tickets-35718771808?aff=ebapi","group_id":"13920680391","group_name":"SGINNOVATE","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/sginnovate-13920680391","formatted_time":"12 Jul 2017, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-12T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-12T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"241302770","name":"Pandas 101 & Networking","description":"Course description: Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. It offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. The name is derived from the term” Panel Data”, an econometrics term for multidimensional structured data sets. It is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the one of the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. Course Outline: In the real-world, data sets comes in many forms ranging from strings, integers, time-stamps and unstructured data. Due to better data collection and the rising adoption rate of IoT. The problem is how do you store data for future references, so that you can manipulate it and derive insight to solve problems for your business? The answer is in a Pandas DataFrame! In this workshop, you'll learn on how to use the industry-standard pandas library to import, build, and manipulate DataFrames. With Pandas, you'll always be able to convert your data into a form that permits you to analyze it easily. You'll also learn more about NumPy on how it stores data, and its relation to the pandas DataFrame.

From robot waiters at Rong Heng Seafood restaurant to bartending robots by robotics startup SousChef, we discuss how robots are built and deployed to interact with humans in a food setting. \n\n\n Tushar Mohan, CEO of SousChef Tushar Mohan is the co-founder and CEO of Soushcef, a Robotics &amp; Automation startup focusing in the F&amp;B industry. He holds a Bachelors in Engineering Product Development (EPD) and a Diploma in Electronics (major in Robotics).  During his time in SUTD, Tushar was involved in various Robotics research projects such as Bio-inspired Robotic Fish, Re-configurable robots etc. and has presented his work in various international conferences in Paris, Newfoundland and San Francisco. He has also worked with JVC-Kenwood, Airbus Innovation, P&amp;G and few other local startups to build innovative automation solutions for their R&amp;D facility.  The entrepreneurship bug bit him when he was in his Junior year of SUTD. Prior to Souschef, he co-founded an ed-tech startup which focused on providing workshops to students in Developing Countries. After running it for one year, he decided to shut down as the business model wasn’t scalable. Fast-forward two years, after pivoting 4 times, making a lot of mistakes, lots of learning, Souschef is now invested by Entrepreneur First SG and have a growing customer base in the South East Asia Pacific. ","location":"NUS Enterprise@Blk71, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-01, Singapore 139951","rsvp_count":75,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Robotics-and-Automation-Singapore/events/236581111/","group_id":21575580,"group_name":"Robotics and Automation Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Robotics-and-Automation-Singapore","formatted_time":"01 Feb 2017, Wed, 6:45 pm","start_time":"2017-02-01T10:45:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-02-01T12:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.2969,"longitude":103.786369},{"id":"237003545","name":"DataJam!","description":"We're looking to increase our contributions to the social sector here in Singapore, and will be having a monthly meeting for volunteers who want to do more. These will be working sessions which can include:  • DataJams where data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis,  • Clinics for social sector organisations to drop in and ask data-related questions, and • Planning sessions for wider community events.  This is a closed, by-invitation only session for volunteers whom we've worked with before. If we've forgotten you (sorry!) or you're new and have a burning desire to join these sessions, please send us a message! For others who can't make it regularly, these sessions are helping us have more community-wide events. Please understand that no food will be provided, so do make preparations to grab a bite before you turn up. Also, it would be great if you bring your own water bottle along too. More details to come!

The program supports startups advancing innovative applications in IoT, big data, sensors and robotics, with potential to develop and commercialize technologies connected to the defence and security sectors. Defence research has driven some of the most transformative consumer innovation in the world including the internet and GPS. Adelaide is a tech-forward city that is building sophisticated infrastructure for startups.\n\nThe accelerator will run in Adelaide, Australia and kicks off in July 2017. During the 3-month intensive program, participants will receive intense mentoring and guidance from key industry experts, and Techstars’ global network of more than 7,000 founders, mentors, investors, and corporate partners. Each company participating in the program receives $20,000 in funding upon acceptance, and access to an additional $100,000 convertible debt note at their sole option.\n\nThis info session will be an informal discussion about Techstars, defence innovation, as well as Techstars Startup Programs in Asia Pacific, and hopefully answer any and all questions you may have about this amazing opportunity. Join us!\n\nGet more application info on the Techstars Adelaide Accelerator, and apply at: https://apply.techstars.com/ + find out more about Startup Weekend at https://startupweekend.org\n\nJoining the team will be Oko Davaasuren and Lalitha Wemel from the Asia Pacific Techstars Startup Programs team.","location":"Collision 8, 1 North Bridge Road High Street Centre, #08-08, Singapore 179094","rsvp_count":33,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/243997109399195","group_id":711704195596196,"group_name":"General Assembly Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/711704195596196","formatted_time":"06 Apr 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-06T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-06T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2898619094989,"longitude":103.84929656982},{"id":"238764822","name":"Path Planning: DESPOT – the best POMDP Solver yet?","description":"Zhan Wei contributed to building one of the best Partially-observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) Solvers in the world, DESPOT. Solving the POMDP problem is one of the key opportunity areas for self-driving cars, in decision-making and path planning. One major obstacle for robotics practitioners in adopting POMDP is that most practical problems get complex very quickly when you describe it in POMDP and end up becoming intractable. DESPOT overcomes a number of these issues using Monte-carlo simulations and sampling. Zhan Wei did his PhD at NUS on algorithms for planning under uncertainty, which is essential to robots that need to make decisions in the real world. He was involved with the software development of APPL, the offline POMDP solver and more recently DESPOT, the online POMDP solver. Dr Lim Zhan Wei is now an engineer at Movel AI, a startup from Entrepreneur First.","location":"SGInnovate, 32 Carpenter Street, Singapore","rsvp_count":53,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup/events/238764822/","group_id":21292690,"group_name":"Singapore Self-driving Car Engineering Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Self-driving-Cars-Engineering-Meetup","formatted_time":"06 Apr 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-06T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-06T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.288118,"longitude":103.847542}]}

In this approach, the process is started by turning a requirement into a specific test case, then code is written to pass the test, and then the cycle is repeated by adding a test for another feature requirement. Benefits of TDD include faster feedback, reduced scope creep and over-engineering, and modular and maintainable code.\r\nThis second day of the workshop will demonstrate the TDD approach in more depth.","location":"StackUp Studio, 79 Ayer Rajah Crescent, #02-09, Singapore 139955","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/productivity-workshop-test-driven-development-part-il-tickets-32181305150?aff=ebapi","group_id":"11924664404","group_name":"StackUp","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/stackup-11924664404","formatted_time":"13 Mar 2017, Mon, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-03-13T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-13T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"nkktpmywfbrb","name":"Social Coding","description":"A space for women coders to learn from each other, to practice and discuss learnings with fellow peers.

It's going to be the first week of this new 7-week course (session starting on 13th March) so be sure to join us now and we can learn and push through the homework &amp; project deadlines together. It's easier to complete such a course in a group. Trust us, we've done it. :)  \"I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me, just like literacy and numeracy, and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything, never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing, I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND2Tetris, it's a tough journey, but you'll be profoundly changed.\" Shimon Schocken, the author of the book talks about the course at TED: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iE7YRHxwoDs How Book Club Works1. Read the chapter and try out (better yet, complete) this week's course homework before you come to the meetup.2. Find something in the chapter you found interesting and maybe research it a little more.3. At the meetup, we go around the room and each person gets a chance to tell the group about the thing they found interesting.4. Group discussion and banter ensues! Book club is held at Tim &amp; Wei's residence: 244A Tanjong Katong RdSingapore  437032Singapore Doors open at 6:30, meetup starts at 7. Bring snacks and drinks of your choice!  FAQ Do I have to take Nand to Tetris Part I before taking Nand to Tetris Part II? From the Coursera course FAQ: \"Nand to Tetris Part I and Nand to Tetris Part II are two separate and stand alone courses. Although it is recommended to take Part I before taking Part II, you can take any of these courses, in any order that suites you.\" Feel free to ask questions in the SingaporeJS bookclub gitter room: https://gitter.im/SingaporeJS/discussions/bookclub Useful Links • NAND to Tetris website: http://www.nand2tetris.org/ • Get the book: http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Computing-Systems-Building-Principles/dp/0262640686/ • Coursera course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2","location":"Tim & Wei's Residence, 244A Tanjong Katong Road, Singapore","rsvp_count":17,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-JS/events/237728285/","group_id":6363162,"group_name":"SingaporeJS","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-JS","formatted_time":"13 Mar 2017, Mon, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-03-13T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-13T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.30649,"longitude":103.895782}]}

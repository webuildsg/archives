It is a board room friendly term that points to the art of making use of multiple mathematical methods to make sense of situations, make projections about near future situations, and support the making of decisions. The objective of this brief *45 minute* session is to give an overview of the methods of “Data Science” and their applications. We will talk about:- the corporate conglomerate friendly area of business intelligence- the popularly known areas of supervised/unsupervised learning- the resurgent domain of neural networks (a.k.a. “deep learning”)- the emerging area of reinforcement learning- the supporting areas of mathematical optimization- and maybe some less known parts of statistical learning This will be about the big ideas and the big applications. About the speaker:This talk will be conducted by our Head of Data Science, Jeremy. Jeremy holds a PhD in Decision Sciences at the National University of Singapore and a Master's Degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Computation for Design and Optimization, where he did a thesis on randomised methods for convex optimization. Jeremy later earned a PhD in Decision Sciences at the National University of Singapore in 2017, with a thesis on \"Social Networks and the Choices People Make\" (discrete choice on social networks). During his PhD days, he also worked on recommendation systems and a start-up building solutions for compliance in pharmaceutical manufacturing.","location":"Tri5 Ventures, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #03-26, S139951, Singapore","rsvp_count":26,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code/events/249491667/","group_id":25157730,"group_name":"Singaporeans Learning To Code","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code","formatted_time":"19 Apr 2018, Thu, 2:30 pm","start_time":"2018-04-19T06:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-04-19T07:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.296735,"longitude":103.78669},{"id":"249013109","name":"April 2018 Singapore Clojure meetup","description":"SP Digital will be hosting us once again this month, we will have one normal 45 mins talk + two 10-15 mins lightning talks for April Clojure meetup, please refer to agenda below for details:- Organizer:Flybot Pte Ltd Sponsor:SP Digital Recording:Engineers.SG will be recording the meetup Agenda:6:30 pm - Food &amp; drinks7:00 pm - Building Mobile Applications with Clojurescript by Binny Arora7:50 pm - Writing shell scripts in Clojure using Planck by Sahil Bajaj8:10 pm - Scheme and the Little Schemer by Anil Thaplar Note to Attendees:Kindly update your attendance before the date of the meetup in order for venue sponsor to setup the place and provide accurate quantity of pizza to prevent wastage.","location":"SP Group, 240 Tanjong Pagar Road #08-00 Keppel Tower 2, Singapore","rsvp_count":29,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup/events/249013109/","group_id":18616301,"group_name":"Singapore Clojure Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Clojure-Meetup","formatted_time":"19 Apr 2018, Thu, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-04-19T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-04-19T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.274367,"longitude":103.842926},{"id":"249452275","name":"Applied Deep Learning for Image and Video Analytics in Enterprises","description":"Please register here, https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/sginnovate-presents-ai-evening-applied-deep-learning-for-image-and-video-analytics-in-enterprises-tickets-44397197212.

","description":"Blazor is a .NET web framework that runs in any browser. You author Blazor apps using C#/Razor and HTML. No JavaScript needed. Blazor uses only the latest web standards. No plugins or transpilation needed. It runs in the browser on a real .NET runtime (Mono) implemented in WebAssembly that executes normal .NET assemblies. It works in older browsers too by falling back to an asm.js based .NET runtime. If you want to get your hands dirty - Prerequisite:Install the .NET Core 2.1 Preview 2 SDK (https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/sdk-2.1.300-preview2) Install the latest preview of Visual Studio 2017 (15.7 Preview 2.0) with the ASP.NET and web development workload (https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/preview/) Note: You can install Visual Studio previews side-by-side with an existing Visual Studio installation without impacting your existing development environment. Install the ASP.NET Core Blazor Language Services extension from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

This time, we are trying something different by including an open-space session alongside reduced usual sharing and talks. With Aurora in Singapore just launched and many more goodies coming later this year, let's get some energy going through the community! As usual, we are looking for speakers who can share for about 10 - 15 mins on a proposed topic. Please drop a message directly on this Meetup page or contact the organisers via our Discord Group https://discord.gg/nkZagBG and we will get it sorted out.

Proposed Schedule &amp; Synopsis - 1845 - 1900: Networking - 1900 - 2030: Speaker: Kong Hai Xun Title: Deep Learning without a power-hungry GPUSpeaking about deep learning, it almost always be confined in the hardware realm of GPU racks, CUDA computing etc. These are bulk hardware that are costy and power hungry. What if you could run the state-of-the-art neural network with the help of a a USB stick on a raspberry pi and achieves decent run-time speed? Find out how this can be done using Intel NCS compute stick. Speaker Bio Hai Xun is an AI Engineer with AI Singapore, a national program to boast AI capabilities in Singapore. He has previous work experience in self driving vehicles, mainly in the area of robot perception system. His main interest is in applied machine learning and computer vision. He also holds a master degree in engineering from NUS. Speaker: Jeanne ChooTitle : Pipelines, packages and practices for better care and feeding of ML systems The traditional Python Data Science Stack is incomplete. While areas like data cleaning, data visualisation and model development are addressed by Pandas, Scikit-learn and Matplotlib, other, equally important features like model reproducibility, interpretability, retraining and lifecycle management have received little attention. Lately, however, academic papers tackling these fields have been published, often with accompanying Python packages. In parallel, practitioners are solving these problems with Python solutions that co-opt ideas from Dev-ops and scientific computing. As a result, we can now build workflows that are accountable to end-users and that adapt well to new data. This talk traces the developments in this space, lists the pipelines, packages and practices that have resulted, and ties these ideas together with a final, end-to-end example. Speaker Bio I started programming at Code and Cake events. In the beginning I mostly ate cake. Over time the ratio shifted in favour of code. I got involved with R Ladies, spoke at Google Developer Dev Fest and ran workshops for people interested data analysis. In my previous life I was a scientist, studying everything from animal behaviour to blood cancer to the predator starfish in our oceans. I believe the key word in data science is science, and enjoy uncovering the ways science and computing inform each other.

Agenda • Introduction &amp; Announcements • \"A primer on Memory Forensics\" by Bart Inglot (45 mins) • \"Life of a Bounty Hunter\" by Quan Yang (45 mins) • \"NAD - A Tool for Dynamic Hooking &amp; Analysis of Android Application\" by Han Lee (15 mins) \n\n\nAbstract:  Title: A primer on Memory Forensics Memory forensics is a powerful analysis and investigative technique used in digital forensics and incident response. With adversaries becoming more sophisticated and carrying out advanced malware attacks, detecting, responding and investigating such intrusions becomes critical to infosec professionals. This presentation introduces you to the topic of memory forensics, it explains how to acquire a memory image, perform analysis using Volatility Framework and demos a few plugins that the speaker developed himself to aid his investigations. Title: Life of a Bounty Hunter Bug bounties is a good source of alternative income as well as a pastime. Learn about the who, what, when, why, where and how about bug bounties and especially, learn first-hand on how to approach bug bounty programs in order to maximize bounties. Title: NAD - A Tool for Dynamic Hooking &amp; Analysis of Android Application This tool is an attempt to be the Burp Suite for Android application methods. It provides the user with several abilities to ease such frustration and make life easier. \n\n\n\nBio(s) of Speakers: Bart Inglot is an Incident Response and Forensics Specialist in MANDIANT's Security Consulting Services team helping clients restore confidence in an event of a breach.

The HTTP protocol does not allow the server to send unsolicited messages to the client. This limitation can be problematic if you’re writing applications that require the occasional server push; for example, chats, multiplayer real-time games, or higher-bid notifications in an online auction\r\nIn this demo-oriented clinic, we will examine some of the techniques used to work around this limitation.\r\n \r\nAgenda\r\n1, What is Server Push?\r\n2.

Safe concurrency is no piece of cake. Goroutines, channels, and select statement provided by Go make concurrent programming easy, but not necessarily safe. “Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating. ” is idiomatic in Go, but it can hardly be enforced. In some cases using channels may be overkill, thus making \"good old\" synchronized sharing the most effective and convenient solution. However, sharing mutable data without proper synchronization leads to data races. This is the main cause of race conditions, aka Public Enemy #1. This talk will introduce two ways to avoid data races: detection in runtime with tools like the race detector provided by Go, and forbidding race conditions at compile time with the type system as Rust does. This talk will also explain why no data races does not mean no race conditions and will include a discussion on how to avoid race conditions in general. Speaker Cheng Wei Cheng Wei obtained his PhD degree from School of Computing, NUS on 2010, and then joined Garena and involved in various projects there. Since 2013, he worked as server team leader of BeeTalk, a social app having tens of millions of active users. \n\n\nSchedule 6:30 PM Registration, mingling and snacks 7:00 PM The Talk 8:00 PM PIZZA, and more mingling","location":"Garena Office,  1 Fusionopolis Place, # 17-10, Galaxis Building, 138522, Singapore","rsvp_count":54,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Garena-Tech-Speak/events/237690988/","group_id":21118555,"group_name":"Garena Tech Speak","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Garena-Tech-Speak","formatted_time":"14 Mar 2017, Tue, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-03-14T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-03-14T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.345871,"longitude":103.7509},{"id":"235981772","name":"PyData Meetup - March 2017","description":" Agenda  • 6:45pm - 7:00pm Networking • 7:00pm - 8:00pm Presentation: Building Glorified Screensavers the Hard Way By Yin Shanyang • 8:00pm - 9:00pm Presentation: De-mystifying Data Stores by Vishnu Rao \n\n\nSynopsis: Let’s build a glorified screensaver using cellular automata, convolution autoencoders, t-sne dimensionality reduction, and recurrent neural networks.

The operations team members must make the code ready for continuous integration and delivery/deployment. This involves making sure your code is unit / integration tests ready and you use patterns such as feature toggles to ensure there is less churn in rolling back changes when you have to. This session provides an overview of CI/CD for operations people and walks through several examples of developing code for CI and CD.","location":"Microsoft Singapore, One Marina Boulevard, Level 22, Meeting Room","rsvp_count":57,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/mssgug/events/233708119/","group_id":18429776,"group_name":"Microsoft User Groups (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/mssgug","formatted_time":"19 Oct 2016, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-10-19T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-19T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"},{"id":"232770485","name":"IxD Session: A conversation with Priscilla Liu","description":"Hello everyone!

Encountered a mysterious bug that got you scratching your head? Or did you just learn how to use a new commandline tool that changed your life? Tell us about it! We encourage presentations of any kind on projects that people work on for fun, for the love of all things technical. The only rules are 1) no startup pitches and 2) no work projects (unless it solves a general problem and is open sourced). Talk slots are 10 minutes long (5 minutes of presentation and 5 minutes of Q&amp;A). First-time speakers and of underrepresented groups in tech are welcome! We'd be glad to help you prepare for your talk.  --- Agenda: 6:30p - 7:00p: Dinner (will be provided)7:00p - 8:00p: Lightning Talks 8:00p - 9:00p: Meet the speakers + mingling Food: Food will be provided for dinner.

This is a talk about the head banging involved just to draw some lines on a map. 2) Saad Chinoy is going to tell us all about microbial fuel cells and how they like Star Wars' The Force in real life. Check it out: http://www.tusitalabooks.com/2017/02/21/mesmerising-microbes/ He'll also be showing us a a working tiny diy microbial fuel cell made with mud at Hack &amp;&amp; Tell, so make sure to be there! 3) Melvin Tiong wrote a JavaScript library to parse Shell variable declarations. If parsing variable declaration syntax is 20% of the work of a shell, does this mean with 400% more effort, we can write a shell in JavaScript?? *alarm bells*. Check the library out here: https://github.com/sneakertack/nvar  4) Nan Xiao will be introducing 3 small CPU tips: endianness, byte-alignment and stack growth, and why it might be important for you to know as a programmer! Check a sneak peek out here: https://github.com/NanXiao/cpu-tips. Nan Xiao's website: http://nanxiao.me/en/ 5) Smit Shah, who build a live-streaming library!

The primary objective of Swarm is to provide a decentralized and redundant store of Ethereum's public record, in particular to store and distribute dapp code and data as well as block chain data. From the end user's perspective, Swarm is not that different from WWW, except that uploads are not to a specific server. The objective is to peer-to-peer storage and serving solution that is DDOS-resistant, zero-downtime, fault-tolerant and censorship-resistant as well as self-sustaining due to a built-in incentive system which uses peer to peer accounting and allows trading resources for payment.

At the end of two hours, you will learn to write simple code in Go, compile it, and execute the program.  This lesson is targeted at new beginners who have no prior background in coding, although existing programmers in learning Go are welcomed to join in as well. As spaces are limited, priority goes to new programmers. This is a very basic course, we highly recommend it to anyone who's interested to pick up coding even if you have no prior background at all. Go is easily the future language of choice for big companies! See these articles on why you should learn go here and why it's the future. For this lesson, you must bring along your own computer (any system) and be prepared to learn how to write code and build websites! There are no other prerequisites. Don't have a computer? Pm me and I will bring one more for you. Spaces are limited for only 30 students. ","location":"Tri5 Ventures, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #03-26, S139951, Singapore","rsvp_count":30,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code/events/242245428/","group_id":25157730,"group_name":"Singaporeans Learning To Code","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singaporeans-Learning-To-Code","formatted_time":"22 Aug 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-22T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-22T13:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.296735,"longitude":103.78669},{"id":"242554241","name":"Security & Continuous Delivery","description":"In this talk, we will share our lessons learned when discussing Continuous Delivery with security teams.

I first encountered their technology in the Arduino 101 when I was building a wearable device last year. It was not clearly mentioned anywhere then, but the Arduino 101 came with 128-nodes neural network based on Neuromem technology! So one could combine the Arduino 101 cpu, accelerometer and gyroscope, and send these outputs to the neural-network for training and predictions - all in a single board! \n\n\nAGENDA 630pm-715pm: Registration and Networking • Introduction to AI@SG (10mins) • Introduction to Neuromorphic Computing with Neuromem (40mins) • Break • AI Computing at the Edge (30mins) • Demo of Neuromem technology (10mins) \n\n\n Speakers Laurence Liew, Director AI@SG Laurence is the Director of AI@SG responsible for industry development, engineering and commerialization of AI@SG partnership with the Singapore ecosystem. Laurence background includes the introduction of commerical open source technologies into Singapore such as Red Hat Linux in 1999, Beowulf HPC computing in 2000, Grid Computing with Globus in 2003 and more recently Enterprise R with Revolution Analytics which was acquired by Microsoft in 2015. \n\n\nGuy Paillet, President and CEO Guy is the inventor of the ZISC (Zero Instruction Set Computer), a neural network digital chip back in 1993. He brings a long experience in semiconductors, in hard-wired artificial vision systems and in parallel pattern recognition architecture to the company. He is an “out-of-the-box” thinker and can solve complex problems related to sensing (especially vision) and artificial intelligence with elegant, yet practical solutions. Guy talent has served in several companies including Data Sud Systems (DSS), IBM, EuroPixels and General Vision Inc. \n\n\nAnne Menendez, Executive VP, Software Engineering Anne Menendez founded General Vision (formerly named GTFS, Inc.) in 1987 to market and sell machine vision systems mostly based on the LabVIEW IMAQ Vision tools. After meeting Guy in 1997 and discovering the ZISC technology, both decided to refocus General Vision towards the design of image recognition systems based on neuromorphic hardware which lead to the development of the NeuroMem technology. Anne participated in the design and development of the NeuroMem CM1K chip. She develops the APIs and tools for the training and integration of NeuroMem hardware into image, signal and text analytics applications.","location":" IMDA Pixel Labs@NDC | National Design Centre , 111 Middle Road S(88969), Singapore (map)","rsvp_count":80,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Singapore-Meetup/events/240381834/","group_id":22704692,"group_name":"Artificial Intelligence Singapore Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Singapore-Meetup","formatted_time":"07 Jun 2017, Wed, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-06-07T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-07T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.298824,"longitude":103.853508},{"id":"240027956","name":"DataJam!","description":"We're looking to increase our contributions to the social sector here in Singapore, and will be having a monthly meeting for volunteers who want to do more. These will be working sessions which can include:  • DataJams where data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis,  • Clinics for social sector organisations to drop in and ask data-related questions, and • Planning sessions for wider community events.  Please understand that no food will be provided, so do make preparations to grab a bite before you turn up. Also, it would be great if you bring your own water bottle along with your laptop and power cable too.

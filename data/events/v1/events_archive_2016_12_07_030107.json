We are promoting this event on behalf of our community member. You must register with the event to book your seat. Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: Hybrid cloud architectures offer the opportunity to build applications and workflows that marry the security and control of an on-premises platform with the flexibility to move workloads to a public cloud to scale capacity as needed. Hybrid cloud implementations are useful in a variety of scenarios, including scaling existing applications to meet growing demands, building a disaster recovery solution, powering cloud-native and mobile applications that need to scale with traffic spikes while maintaining security and compliance requirements, and facilitating Agile development practices. Underlying all hybrid cloud use cases is the need for an efficient and scalable stream message delivery system to connect the on-premises data center with the public cloud deployment(s). Kafka and other publish-subscribe message systems offer a natural paradigm for integrating on-premises and on-cloud workloads. Moreover, the integration of stream processing frameworks, such as Spark Streaming and Flink, with these Kafka-based message systems enables real-time analytics to be performed at scale in hybrid cloud environments. Ted Dunning describes how a publish-subscribe message system can be used to architect a hybrid cloud solution, how a streaming message system can be used in a complex hybrid cloud application, and how to combine sensor data from global IoT applications running in multiple public clouds. Along the way, Ted also covers how to leverage on-premises analysis in a stream processing framework on Hadoop, such as Spark Streaming or Flink, and the trade-offs between some the competing message systems and stream processing frameworks. Location: Summit 2 Agenda: 1:45pm to 2:25pm - Architecting a hybrid cloud application using a global publish-subscribe streaming message system Speaker: Mathieu Dumoulin has started using Hadoop from the deep end, building a full unstructured data classification prototype for Fujitsu Canada’s Innovation Labs back in 2012-2013.

We are promoting this event on behalf of our community member. You must register with the event to book your seat. Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: Many Asian countries, including Indonesia, are still living in an offline world. Most data is still in an analog form and is disconnected due to the lack of a single identity that could link them together. The two combinations made it very hard to analyze data for business or economic development. Most people don’t realize that, even today, most of data preparation process is still done manually and requires a lot of effort from a large number of data scientists to do it, which can be quite impractical. Big data technology allows disconnected offline data to go digital and connect with one another. This enables companies and government to get a better view of its individuals and other entities, contextually gain insights on what matters for them and finally validates and optimizes their spending and investments. Mediatrac has been developing intelligent data preparation platform on top of Hadoop infrastructure using Apache Spark that combines Knowledge Graph and machine learning to automate the whole process and make the process done more quickly. Imron Zuhri shares several data connectivity use cases in the areas of marketing, sales and distribution, finance, telecommunication, healthcare, agriculture, and legal (in both the private sector and government) and explains how to leverage distributed computing to tackle massive entity recognition and resolution problems. Topics include:-How Mediatrac collects data-How Mediatrac purpose built big data architecture engages to convince legacy teams to take a big data approach-Supporting tools using also the Knowledge Graph and machine learning that automate data scanning and the text-recognition process-How Mediatrac prepares data-The process of data cleansing and data connectivity in Indonesia-How Mediatrac integrates data and contextually interconnects the data at the cell level-How Mediatrac utilizes Apache Spark and Apache Accumulo databases to contextually match data from one source to another Prerequisite Knowledge:Basic knowledge of Apache Spark What you'll learn:Learn how knowledge graph and big data can be implemented in various industry to tackle its data problems and improve business performance Explore Mediatrac's big data technology platform focused on data connectivity, object profiling, and knowledge discovery and understand use cases Location: 334/335 Agenda: 4:15pm to 4:55pm - Using big data technology to solve data connectivity in a disconnected world Speaker: Imron Zuhri is the founder and chief technical director at Mediatrac, where he is responsible for herding the pack of nerds, the data scientist, and data engineers in the company. Together with his wife, Imron also established Erudio School of Art, the only democratic school-of-the-art high school in Indonesia. He has a wide interest in math, physics, astronomy, movies, music, photography, and literature, but first and foremost, he is obsessed with understanding human behavior, perhaps to compensate for his lack of social interaction. ****You must register with the event to book your seat**** Register here: https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-sg/public/register We are promoting selected sessions of this event as they align with our group interests.

Strata + Hadoop World is where cutting-edge data science and new business fundamentals merge. It’s a deep-immersion experience where data scientists, analysts, and business executives dissect case studies, develop new skills, share emerging best practices, and build the future of big data. Abstract: The unique properties of data make assessing its value difficult when using the traditional approaches of intangible asset valuation. John Akred discusses a number of alternative approaches to valuing data within an organization for specific purposes, including informing decisions to purchase third-party data and monitoring data’s value internally to manage and increase that value over time. Data is difficult to value in large part because, economically, it does not adhere to the three main conditions of a traditional market system. In addition, traditional valuation methods of intangible assets do not apply to data valuation. Cost: Data is often produced as a byproduct of other business processes, making its cost hard to pin down. Comparables: Data varies greatly by content and quality so comparables are difficult to find. Forecasts: The dominance of data aggregators and one-on-one deals in the buying and selling of data obscure the prices of any comparables that may actually exist in the market. While a traditional valuation of data may not be applicable, John explores data’s value in the context of specific uses and intentions within an organization, sharing several examples of how to use methods such as the value of information (VOI) framework and A/B testing to assess whether or not a third-party data source should be purchased or continue to be purchased and demonstrating how mutual information (MI) can be used to assess the value of a data source once it is in use within the organization. John concludes by discussing the qualities that make data more valuable within an organization and provides a range of concrete and straightforward metrics that allow the value of data to be monitored internally to ensure that business decisions can be optimized to maximize that value over time. What you'll learn:Understand how to value data so that you can best make business decisions Location: 328/329 Agenda: 5:05pm to 5:45pm - What's your data worth? Speaker: With over 15 years in advanced analytical applications and architecture, John Akred is dedicated to helping organizations become more data driven. As CTO of Silicon Valley Data Science, John combines deep expertise in analytics and data science with business acumen and dynamic engineering leadership. ****You must register with the event to book your seat**** Register here: https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/hadoop-big-data-sg/public/register We are promoting selected sessions of this event as they align with our group interests.

But it gained its interest in the recent years due to the penetration of Internet and smartphones in the remotest of places. The reduction of cost due to competition in embedded sector has also played a huge role in its adoption.  With more automation and increase in usage of machine learning, sensor data has become an important part of Big data. These sensor networks/IoT devices finds their use in area monitoring, healthcare sector, environmental monitoring, industrial monitoring, security sector etc. But this also increases the risk of exploitation by malicious users. There are multiple IoT devices which are prone to different kind of attacks allowing a malicious user to take control of it and use it for other purposes. Apart from device security, data in transit also requires security. Data can suffer from man in the middle attack, allowing a malicious user to decode the data or manipulate in transit. The risk here depends upon the kind of application which is used.  In this talk we are going to discuss about different types of attacks that happens in the IoT and how to prevent them. We will also cover some cryptographic algorithms and digital signatures methods for security purposes.  Vishram is the co-founder of MicroSec, a startup specializing in providing data and device security to low power and low bandwidth sensor network/IoT devices. He obtained his PhD in Computer Engineering from NTU in 2015 and worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher in SUTD for an year. During his PhD he worked on Cognitive Radio and during his postdoc he worked on design and development of IoT gateways and sensor nodes.

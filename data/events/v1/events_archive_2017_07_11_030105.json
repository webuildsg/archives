In this session, we will use the Design Thinking Toolkit. For experienced Designers, it will be interesting as we are discussing and designing the Innovation Ecosystem. For individuals who are interested in Design Thinking you will get some hands-on experience. We hope to see you all on Tuesday, July 11th at 6 pm at NUS Enterprise. \n\n\nDesigned for Innovation SeriesCompanies large and small are increasingly turning to innovation to sustain their competiveness. Many try to adopt innovation methods practiced by startups (customer development, MVPs, validated learning, intrapreneurship, etc.) while some even try to annex whole startups through incubation and accelerator programs. Unfortunately, the outcomes have been a mixed bag. Lean startup practices are hard to implement in large organizations, and feisty startups rarely thrive within rigid corporate frameworks.  This collaborative meetup series between NUS Enterprise and Design Innovation SG will explore if there is a better way for corporations to tap the entrepreneurship wave. We shall examine how Design Thinking strategies may be adapted to help companies better engage the startup ecosystem. Experienced innovators, designers, strategists and practitioners will be invited to share and discuss what did and did not work in their own innovation journeys. In the first seminar on 21st February at 6pm, we will explore how to bring &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Design Thinking into Organizations &amp;lt;&amp;lt;. Please only sign up, if you are coming as the spaces are limited and bring your business card with you.","location":"The Franklin , 3 Science Park Drive #01-06/09 , Singapore","rsvp_count":40,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Design-Innovation-Singapor/events/238643165/","group_id":18241528,"group_name":"Design Innovation Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Design-Innovation-Singapor","formatted_time":"11 Jul 2017, Tue, 6:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-11T10:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-11T12:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.291343,"longitude":103.787033},{"id":"35910664765","name":"Preview Talk - StackUp","description":"\nGET STARTED IN TECH NOW\nDo you want to be a developer or an engineer?

We are excited to host R3's Corda Enterprise Lead Mike Ward who is visiting Singapore from Sydney. Mike will present R3's Corda for the local business and technical community. Corda is an open-sourced distributed ledger platform designed from the ground up to record, manage and synchronise financial agreements between regulated financial institutions. It is heavily inspired by and captures the benefits of blockchain systems, without the design choices that make blockchains inappropriate for many banking scenarios. Schedule 6:15pm - 7pm Arrive, relax, and mingle 7pm - 7:45pm Identity on a distributed ledger The topic of Identity in financial services is one of the great issues of the day. Governments and regulators alike have the bit between their teeth in terms of holding the financial industry to account for any financial crime admitted through their infrastructures. The unstoppable trend to digitalisation of services only increases the channels and traffic that must be monitored as well as the opportunities for criminals to hide their activity behind bogus or genuine identities. Ever increasing compliance requirements are the norm, along with associated fines for non-compliance, and yet banks have very few new tools with which to effectively identify and prevent criminal or unethical activity, from both external and internal sources. Distributed ledgers, with cryptographic securing of records built into their DNA, are a natural place to look for new solutions.  7:45pm - 8pm Q &amp; A Please check back here for any updates.","location":"PayPal, 5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, Singapore 038985, ThanksGiving Room","rsvp_count":28,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Corda-Meetup/events/237896248/","group_id":22297058,"group_name":"Singapore Corda Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Corda-Meetup","formatted_time":"27 Feb 2017, Mon, 6:15 pm","start_time":"2017-02-27T10:15:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-02-27T12:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"},{"id":"227868333","name":"HackerNest Singapore February 2017 Tech Social","description":"HackerNest Tech Socials are a fun, relaxed way to connect with your local tech community.

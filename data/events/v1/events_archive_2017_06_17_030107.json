Through Sound Meditation (2/3)","description":"\n\n\"The word LISTEN contains the same letters as the word SILENT.\"\n\n\n- Alfred Brendel\n\nIn everyday's conversations we often talk but forgot to listen. We often speak, but forgot to hear.Our mind is a clutter of chatters and noises where wisdom doesn't come through.How do we have a clarity of mind? How do we clear the clouds inside our head?What does our heart truly say? How can we hear ourself? How do we connect better?Quantum Zazen is for everyone. It is a place of clarity and connection and where silence speaks the loudest.It is a place where we feel centered, balanced, and focused. It is a place where we know exactly where we are.If you'd like to have a clarity of mind, focus, direction, or answers to your own questions, this place is for you!In this series of Awaken Your Senses meditation, we will focus on our ears to listen to the sounds outside and inside our self.Find your inner strength to leap further in all aspects of your life.Connect to the silence, and find the loudest noise that calls you forward or drag you backward.When: Saturday, 17 June. 08:30 am - 11:00 amWhere: Labrador Park MRTFree of charge!

We are inviting makers from the UWCSEA community to build projects with locally based makers and excite the wider public about the maker movement. We’ll be having an open briefing for incoming makers on the 17th June (9.30am) at the Community Lab@UWCSEA East Campus. \n\nHere are the project details:\n1) Make Arcade Games\nEveryone loves games. In this project, we'll be using games as a way to introduce people to the world of making. We'll be creating awesome games that just about anyone can make using materials that can be found around us. We'll be creating an arcade full of games!\n\n2) Make Tools For Mini Makers\nWe all love using tools like the power drill, hand saw to even the simplest craft knife. But they can be dangerous for anyone using it. Sometimes, we keep young people away from these tools because we are afraid that they might hurt themselves. We'll be designing and making tools safe for kids to use!\n\n3) Make Drill Powered Long Boards\nElectric vehicles from unicycles to scooters and hover boards have become one of the main mode of transport in Singapore. However, not everyone can afford buying an electric scooter ranging from $400 to $1000. Come join us as we make a drill powered long board to cruise around during Maker Faire!\n\n4) Detecting Plant Disease using Artificial Intelligence\nFor some of who love gardening, plant diseases are something we dread. When any sign of diseases emerges, we would quickly attempt to address it and treat the plant. Come join us as we use Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence technology to detect plant diseases!\n\nApply now at http://bit.ly/CommLabMF17\nFor enquiries, please contact Melissa at 97970213 or communitylab@sl2square.org.","location":"Community Lab at United World College SEA, 1 Tampines Street 73, #01-D119, Singapore 528704","rsvp_count":5,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1853231208260385","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"17 Jun 2017, Sat, 9:30 am","start_time":"2017-06-17T01:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-17T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.35782,"longitude":103.93187},{"id":"643757272484992","name":"ArtScience on Screen: Anime Season – Castle in the Sky","description":"ArtScience on Screen: Anime Season – Castle in the Sky\n\nCastle in the Sky follows the adventures of young orphans Sheeta and Puza, who make a risky escape from military agents and pirates, in search of a legendary floating castle with their mysterious crystal amulet.\n\nIn conjunction with Children’s Season, ArtScience on Screen presents this extraordinary, award-winning animated classic from iconic animation company, Studio Ghibli.

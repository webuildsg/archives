I design creative user interface and am honoured to be a member of the advisory board for the Google Launchpad accelerator for startups. I have a Ph.D. in cognitive psychology and user interface design. Building innovative, top-of-the-line UX solutions and applications has been my passion for the last 20+ years. Before becoming an independent consultant, I co-founded two companies: UI Ltd. (which is the largest company in Israel for UX design) and Applied Cognitive Engineering, Ltd. (ACE) for cognitive training.  In addition to working as strategic UX consultant, I coordinate the UX activity for Google’s Launchpad program, an acceleration program for startups. I have created UX expert communities for helping startups in Berlin, Paris, Barcelona, Bangalore, Rio de Janeiro, Jakarta, Mexico City and many more places. I have had the honour of meeting over 700 startups around the world and helping them turn their dreams into reality. Agenda for the night 7pm – 7.30pm: Registration, drinks and networking (no food served, feel free to bring your own!)  7.30pm – 8.30pm: Conversation with Dr Jacob 8.30pm – 9pm: Networking and drinks :) We're hoping to keep the session really informal and casual where it is more conversational centric so bring along some of your burning questions to the session. The value of the meetup is as good as the questions asked :) Also, if you would like to ask the question privately, please email me at kiat@ixda.sg and I'll ask them on your behalf :) Alternatively, you may like to tweet us the questions to @IxDASG and we can have that answered! Venue sponsor  A very big thanks to the folks at Collision 8 for sponsoring the venue! Thanks to Bryant, Xinyi, Jen for making this happen! P.s: Apologies for the very short notice! We feel that having Dr Jacob to share would be valuable for many so we decided to organise it in an agile fashion. If you're unable to make it, we'll make sure recordings are available! ","location":"Collision 8 High Street Centre, 1 North Bridge Road #08-08, Singapore","rsvp_count":182,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/IxDA-Singapore/events/240582296/","group_id":2725412,"group_name":"IxDA Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/IxDA-Singapore","formatted_time":"12 Jun 2017, Mon, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-12T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-12T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.290107,"longitude":103.849129}]}

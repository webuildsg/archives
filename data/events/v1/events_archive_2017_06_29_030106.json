Often security gets aligned with compliance timelines or other long-cycle process inside an organization. This session is complete reversal of the status quo and we will cover modern approaches to security in your CI/CD pipelines. You will gain experience with some of the testing tools and processes needed to make this happen. We will also cover some advice for dealing with compliance and security engineers as you make a transition to TDD-style approach to security. Introduction to HashiCorp Vault  The session will focus on the introduction to Vault that secures, stores, and tightly controls access to tokens, passwords, certificates, API keys, and other secrets in modern computing. Vault handles leasing, key revocation, key rolling, and auditing. Through a unified API, users can access an encrypted Key/Value store and network encryption-as-a-service, or generate AWS IAM/STS credentials, SQL/NoSQL databases, X.509 certificates, SSH credentials, and more.  \n\n\n\nSpeakers Bio:  James spends a lot of time at the intersection of the DevOps and Security communities. He works as Head of Research at Signal Sciences and is a supporter of the Rugged Software and Rugged DevOps movements. Seeing the gap in software testing, James founded an open source project, Gauntlt, to serve as a Rugged Testing Framework. He is the author of DevOps Fundamentals, Infrastructure Automation, both DevOps core courses available on Lynda.com and LinkedIn Learning. Fabian born and brewed in Singapore, learned his software engineering skills while working in the USA contributing DevSecOps engineer. What excites him most is cybersecurity, red teaming, fitness and of course quality alcohol. A practitioner of various martial arts and a Krav Maga instructor. ","location":"GovTech@Hive, 1 Fusionopolis View, #08-01 Sandcrawler, Singapore 138577","rsvp_count":63,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/DevSecOps-Singapore/events/240905188/","group_id":19432258,"group_name":"DevSecOps Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DevSecOps-Singapore","formatted_time":"29 Jun 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-29T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-29T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.299671,"longitude":103.78939},{"id":"239659862","name":"DevOps on Azure using Kubernetes","description":"Please register at security counter at level 1 and then proceed to level 21.  On level 21 look for room Room 21MPR-01. \n\n\n\nI am excited to announce two talks at this User Group. 1.

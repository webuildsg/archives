They are currently building and testing their ground-to-ground communication prototypes which allows 1 Gbps connectivity across 5km. Subsequently, this link will be expanded to ground-to-air, ground-to-edge of space and then to Low Earth Orbit. Some use cases for terrestrial links include backhaul links, marine connectivity, and CCTV connectivity. \nLydia Lim - Associate Opinion Editor at Straits Times Singapore\nSince joining the paper in 1999, she has covered local politics, policies and Singapore-Malaysia relations, three journalism beats that have taken her around the island and the world, including to international courts in Hamburg and the Hague for two exciting hearings on reclamation and Pedra Branca. In her current day job, she edits the paper's Opinion pages.

More critical than your products, is knowing your customers, your market, your partners and investors.  You need to raise capital to grow your company and achieve your goals.  Investors on the hand use many different criteria to gauge the viability of a business.  By seeing your product through the lens of an investor, you’ll know where to place emphasis in the limited resources you have to gear your start-up to fly.\nJoin us for the 1st of a two-part workshop where attendees will learn to build out a pitch deck with execution to details that ‘speaks’ to your investors.  \nSpeaker: Stuart SMITH\nChief, Digital Innovation & Design Practice\nStuart is Chief of Service Innovation & Design at National University of Singapore’s Institute of Systems Science (NUS-ISS).

However, R is by nature limited in scalability and parallelism, and thus, restrained for wide deployment in enterprise-grade applications. Contemporary big data solution and AI application services are migrating from on-premise to cloud owing to apparent benefits of flexibility in scaling up/out resources, computational efficiency, and cost effectiveness. To better leverage advantages of cloud computing and smooth the process of embracing cloud, the community needs R packages as well as associated paradigms that allow R-user data scientists, data engineers, etc. to operationalize enterprise-grade pipeline for cloud based data analytic and AI development. The talk will briefly introduce how Microsoft Cloud and AI group contributes to R community on democratizing cloud based data and AI development framework for enterprises and individuals. Demo in the talk will cover how one can deploy, manage, and operationalize cloud computing resources such as Spark cluster, DSVM with GPU, etc., for versatile and agile analytical and development tasks, ALL in a local R session.  Speaker Bio-----------------Le Zhang is a Data Scientist with Microsoft Cloud and AI group. He joined Microsoft since the year of 2016, after working as a data scientist in Broadcom where he built analytical algorithms and tools for semiconductor chip yield prediction. His work in Microsoft is primarily focused on researching and developing enterprise-ready cloud product and service for AI application and big data analytics. He has experience in the domains of predictive maintenance, human resource analytics, finance services, etc. He holds a Ph.

These will be working sessions which can include: • DataJams where data is cleaned and prepped for further analysis, • Clinics for social sector organisations to drop in and ask data-related questions, and • Planning sessions for wider community events. Directions to NVPC NVPC is located on the 4th floor blue zone at the Central (above Clarke Quay MRT station). When you are in the blue zone, you should be on the side opposite from the river, i.e. facing the Hive co working building. When you are on the ground floor of the Central, look for the escalator opposite Ya Kun kaya toast. Take the escalator there up, floor by floor to the 4th floor. On the 4th floor, walk straight down the corridor till you reach the end of the corridor and there'll be a door on the right.   UPDATE: For this session, there will be pizza available, with vegetarian and Halal options catered for. We seek your understanding that this is a one-time departure from the usual DataJam sessions where no food will be provided. Also, it would be great if you bring your own water bottle along with your laptop and power cable too.

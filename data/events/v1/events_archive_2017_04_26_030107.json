Dependency-Injection (DI) allows us to easily achieve this by following the Single-Responsibility Principle and the go-to solution on Android platform is Dagger2. In Shopee's Android app, we have been using Dagger2 for over 2 years. During this process, we realised how powerful it can be to help us manage dependencies and their lifecycle in our application. In this talk we share some tips, use cases and design patterns around Dagger2 in Android and how it has helped us build a sustainable code-base for Shopee.

This week we'll be having Peter over to talk about Nix and NixOS. Nix and its related technologies bring a radically different approach to server/container management and allows you to provision OS and software in repeatable and consistent ways. Also, if you're curious about row hammering as a means of exploitation, mentioned last Friday Hacks by Halvar, Vishnu will be sharing about it in detail in the second talk.\n\nTitle: (Programming your OS && ignoring state) == bliss\n\nDescription:\nNixOS fundamentally changes how we approach servers, instances and infrastructure and it all comes down to a quirky functional programming language named \"nix\".\n\nThis talk covers some of the problems we can solve when we don't have to care about mutating state and how adding a real programming language to our infrastructure enables us to do things we couldn't do before.\n\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nPeter runs a small managed services company called Speartail, is CTO of a local SaaS startup and runs technical consulting company C2P4 with a partner where they help companies kick their tech stack and development processes into the next gear. He is also learning the violin much to his neighbors frustration.\n\nHe's @peterhoeg in most places online.\n\nTalk 2:\nRow Hammer: Flipping Bits in Memory Without Accessing Them\n\nDescription:\n“Row Hammer” is a problem with DRAM in which repeatedly accessing a row of memory can cause bit flips in adjacent rows. This talk will be describing how DRAM chips work, how the row hammer problem occured and finally how random bit flips in memory can be exploited into a privilege escalation attack.\n\nSpeaker Profile:\nVishnu Prem is a senior Computer Science student in NUS who’s involved with the coreteam of NUS Hackers and the Singaporean tech scene. In the last few years, he has worked on software engineering projects for Twitter, Apple & Uber.\n\nSponsors:\nThis event is kindly sponsored by NUS Enterprise.","location":"SR5, Town Plaza, University Town, NUS, , Singapore","rsvp_count":13,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/753440961479248","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"07 Apr 2017, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2017-04-07T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-07T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"qndnvlywgbkb","name":"Let's meet to share about improvised lab equipment and home experiments","description":"This is part of our regular meet-ups, scheduled for the first Friday evening of the month.

We're having our DataDive on the weekend of 7-9 April! What is a DataDive?  A DataDive is a weekend long event where non-profit organizations work alongside data science volunteers, developers and designers to analyze data to gain insight into their programs, the communities they serve and more. Unlike a hackathon, there is no competition and no winner; instead, everyone is working towards the common goal of helping the non-profit organizations be more effective at what they do. Check out the project statements for each organization below: Singapore Children Society  We want to use {survey data from professionals and the public} to {analyze cohort indicators and group differences at various levels} so that {Singapore Children Society can better understand the similarities and differences in Child Abuse perceptions}. Singapore Red Cross We want to use {Blood Donation Drive Data} to {analyze factors affecting amount of blood collected during a blood donation drive} so that {Singapore Red Cross Blood Donor Recruitment Programme can better understand these factors and improve the efficiency of future Blood Drives}.  O'Joy Care Services Established in 2004 by a group of social workers and professional counsellors, O'Joy aims to enhance the psychosocial well-being of the elderly, as well as their families.   We want to use {the Community Mental Health Intervention Team (COMIT) dataset} to {analyze anonymized client medical history treating the elderly at risk of or diagnosed with depression, anxiety and/or dementia} so that {O'Joy can better understand their clients' needs and plan their resources}. Special thanks to Expedia for being our venue sponsor! Schedule Friday, Apr 7th  7 pm: Doors open, sign-in  (we're on the 6th floor!) 7.30 pm: Introduction to Non-Profit Organizations and Data challenge8.15 pm: Meet and greet, team forming 9 pm: Close for the night It's a great chance to learn about the non-profits and their data, meet the other volunteers you'll be working and talk with others from our partner causes! Saturday, Apr 8th 9 am: Doors open, sign-in9.30 am: Brief review from Team leads, then data diving! 12.30 pm: Lunch 1 pm: Open Roundtables 6 pm: Dinner 9 pm: Everybody goes home for the night Saturday we'll start work on the data!  DataDivers will choose which problems they'd like to work on and form teams around their individual questions. There will be roving DataKind project team leads who will help advise on and manage the projects throughout the day.   Sunday, Apr 9th 9 am:  Doors open, sign-in 9.30am: Brief review from Team leads, then data diving! 12.30 pm: Lunch1 pm: Prepare presentation4 pm: Team presentations 5 pm: Another successful DataDive in the books! This is your chance to show the world what you have done with data, and for our non-profit partners to better understand what your team did! These presentations can be single or group work, but they can be no longer than 10 minutes each.  We want to give everyone a chance to speak, and get people out at a reasonable time.   Other items of note for the weekend Please do the following Docker setup on your laptop We held a DataLearn on reproducible research, so volunteers attending the DataDive can setup Docker needed for the DataDive. If you've missed the DataLearn session, you can watch the video here. Volunteers at all levels are welcome throughout the weekend. If you're already a pro, we're looking for some subject-area experts to help with project preparation and be resources throughout the DataDive.   Unlike a hackathon, the goal is not (necessarily) to create an app, and it is not a competition. Instead, the objective is to work with teams of experts to understand a difficult problem through data.  You could end up with a visualization, an analysis, some graphs, or even just some new datasets by the end of the event, and all of those are fantastic results! There is a Github repository setup to use for sharing code and analyses during the event. This will be our primary resource for capturing everything developed at the DataDive, so please use it for sharing and collaboration. You do not have to stay the entire weekend to participate in the event.  We hope that you will find a project you can dig into, but you are always welcome to come and go as you please. You do not have to work on the same project for the whole weekend.  Again, we hope that you will find a project to work on to completion, but if at any point you feel like you want to change simply let the DataKind project team lead for your team know. We do not provide any hardware or software for you to use. We'll have the data and some services set up (Trello,slack, Github), but otherwise you should bring your own laptop and come ready to use whatever data tools you like. What should you bring? • Your laptop + power • A water bottle to refill• Lots of energy and enthusiasm!  See you there!","location":"Expedia Singapore, 6th Floor, South Beach Tower, 38 Beach Road, Singapore 189767","rsvp_count":100,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/DataKind-SG/events/237997809/","group_id":16412132,"group_name":"DataKind SG","group_url":"http://meetup.com/DataKind-SG","formatted_time":"07 Apr 2017, Fri, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-07T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-09T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.295903,"longitude":103.856461},{"id":"1170409706414816","name":"Future Fridays: What Lenses are We Wearing?","description":"We are always clearheaded and objective, right?

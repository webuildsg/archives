Please note of our attendance policy ( https://www.meetup.com/DataScience-SG-Singapore/events/228169542/ ). Attendees are REQUIRED to RSVP to the event to be allowed into the venue.

Proposed Schedule &amp; Synopsis - 1845 - 1900: Networking - 1900 - 2030: Speaker: Allen DayDesignation: Developer Advocate, Google Cloud Title: Blockchain Analytics on Real-time DatastreamsSynopsis: Blockchains provide a solution for communication and coordination amongst peers in low-trust environments. Use cases are emerging in the financial services, supply chain, media, and other sectors. While blockchains provide transactional and durability features for data capture and storage, they’re not easy to use for extracting specific or aggregate insights about data stored on-chain. In this presentation, we demonstrate how Google Cloud can be used to:perform a real-time extraction of data from a blockchain databasefurther refine and distribute the data with PubSub, graph database JanusGraph on BigTable, and OLAP database BigQueryderive insights from the extracted data with DataStudio and DataLab. Speaker: Sara RobinsonDesignation: Developer Advocate, Google Cloud Title: Text analysis: from pre-trained APIs to custom modelsSynopsis: Most applications deal with text data in some form: from chat messages to product reviews to comments and more. Making sense of large amounts of text data manually is difficult and time consuming. Luckily, advances in natural language processing (NLP) have given us a variety of tools to help analyze text. Whether you’re new to ML or you’ve already built your own custom model, by the end of this talk you’ll know how to get started adding NLP to your own application. I’ll begin by introducing the Cloud Natural Language API, which lets you utilize a pre-trained model to get insights from your text with a single API call. Then I’ll discuss how to build a custom model trained on your own data using TensorFlow and Cloud ML Engine, with lots of live demos along the way. Name: Markku LepistoDesignation: Solutions Architect, Google Cloud Title: Google Cloud AutoMLSynopsis: Join this session to see AutoML Vision in action, to easily and quickly create a custom Vision API model. In this live demo, Markku will show an example of creating training data sets, training a model with AutoML, and using it for inference. The use case here is to see if we can detect which 'rubber stamp' was used to 'chop' scanned documents' pages.

The tech industry is well-known to be male-dominated and the digital currency space as a subset has shown itself to be the same, with some studies and research even showing that space might be more male-dominated than the general technology industry. In recent times, however, the crypto space is seeing encouraging signs in terms of gender diversity – female speakers are becoming more visible and the number of female attendees has increased significantly. Hope is one of the female leaders on the frontier of using blockchain technology to create better supply chain infrastructure. She will share her experience and personal story in leading a global team and managing a B2B blockchain enterprise solutions company since 2015 as a female CEO/Co-Founder in this male-dominated industry. ### Program ### 6:30 - 7:00 Registration7:00 - 8:00 AMA session: Power, Future Women in Blockchain8:00 - 8:30 Networking ### Speaker ### Hope Liu, CEO of Eximchain Hope is a veteran in the supply chain space.

With the basics of XCUITest out of the way, he will introduce the Cucumberish library that helps to improve your existing XCUITest suite.Cucumberish segment will interest you if- you want to know how \"Given Then When\" Behavioural Driven Tests can help your iOS Tests- you are interested in executing \"Given Then When\" BDD Feature files in Xcode- you are not convinced with external cross platform testing tool like Appium and Calabash (because you want to write your tests using Swift)- you want to bring this learning back to work. Feel free to ask more questions during QnA • Writing High-Performance Swift CodeThongchai (Luke) will be sharing about dimensions of performance for Swift language, starting from the basics of allocation, reference counting, and method dispatch. Then he will share stories and ways the compiler can optimise our code and how we can take advantage of it.Finally, he will use Hopper disassembler to inspect how the compiler modifies our code. ----------iOS Conf SG 2017: iOS Conf SG is South East Asia's only annual iOS Conference organised by iOS Dev Scout.

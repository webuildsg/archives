However, when the system is compromised and requires careful forensic analysis, FDE can be quite painful to forensic analysts. Unless you deal with standard and widely supported encryption such as LUKS, Bitlocker, TrueCrypt or few others, it might really hard to get through the layers of crypto code in proprietary software. This presentation will attempt to solve this by introducing a way to break into live running custom FDE setup remotely. PHONE BASED AUTHENTICATION SCHEMEBy merging crypto challenge (as in TLS) into push notification - and using our IRP protocol to get key material (client cert and private key) onto the phone. BIOSVITALY KAMLUK has been involved in malware research at Kaspersky Lab since 2005. In 2008, he was appointed Senior Antivirus Expert, before going on to become Director of the EEMEA Research Center in 2009. He spent a year in Japan focusing on major local threats affecting the region. In 2014 he was seconded to the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation in Singapore, where for 2 years he worked in the INTERPOL Digital Crime Center specializing in malware reverse engineering, digital forensics and cybercrime investigation. Vitaly has presented at many public international security conferences including Blackhat USA, Blackhat Asia, Defcon, Hitcon, BSides LasVegas, PHDays, ZeroNights, FIRST, Ruxcon as well as multiple closed door invite-only security industry events. He is a trainer of Yara for threat intelligence researchers and an author of open-source project Bitscout for remote digital forensics. NICOLAS COLLERY has been in the security field for over 15 years, focusing on fighting cybercrime. Passionate about forensics, malware analysis, and now simulating attacks focusing on real-adversaries tactics, techniques and procedure (TTP) to assess capability to prevent, detect and respond. He has worked on the implementation of some of the current security controls that help to provide security and peace of mind to its customers. LAWRENCE HUGHES has been working with security for quite a few years. He created a secure messaging system for the US IRS about 30 years ago based on DES and X9.17 Key Management Facility. In 1998 - 2000 he worked for VeriSign and created and delivered their training in crypto and PKI internationally. In 2000 he co-founded CipherTrust where he was the first CTO. He created the sole product, the first email security gateway, called IronMail – it blocked hacking attacks, did opportunistic encryption, and later removed malware and spam. He later created InfoWeapons in Cebu PH and created a very secure DNSSEC appliance (SolidDNS). This easily passed US DoD JITC certification (Joint Interoperability Test Command). It was the first fully IPv6 compliant DNS appliance. At Sixscape he has created a breakthrough Identity Management protocol called IRP – granted port 4604 by IANA. It is at the heart of a lot of the things that they do there. They do advanced cryptographic authentication (replace username/password authentication), secure messaging, and other security tools.","location":"Ernst & Young (EY), 1 Raffles Quay, North Tower, Singapore","rsvp_count":140,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/div-zero/events/250890071/","group_id":25714422,"group_name":"Division Zero (Div0) – Singapore Cybersecurity Community","group_url":"http://meetup.com/div-zero","formatted_time":"21 Jun 2018, Thu, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2018-06-21T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-06-21T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.28121,"longitude":103.851486},{"id":"250199469","name":"June 2018 Singapore Clojure Meetup","description":"Dear Clojurians, it's mid of the year. This time round, our friend at PALO IT(http://sg.palo-it.com/) will be hosting us, a big THANK YOU to PALO IT. The agenda has been planned for you below: =================June Clojure meetup agenda================- 6:30pm: Pizza, drinks &amp; chat- 7:00pm: François De Serres - Full Stack Datalog &amp; Its Benefits- 7:45pm: Kiran Karkera - Building REST APIs with Compojure- 8:30pm: Networking =========================Our Speakers=======================**François De Serres**Francois De Serres is the Head of Digital Technology at PALO IT Singapore. Passionate about new technologies, and people, François has recruited and guided large development teams. He has also set up and led complex IT programs using both waterfall and agile, and constantly succeeds in helping stakeholders achieve their objectives for more than 20 years.===============What to expect from François' talk================Clojurists are aware of the superpowers of Datomic, the immutable database. DataScript is a very similar, but lightweight Datalog DB that runs in the browser. Reader conditionals (.cljc) allows devs to write code once that runs on both Java and JS runtimes. Server-Sent Events (Websockets) allow for lean, asynchronous client/server protocols, and “reactive” applications. At PALO IT, they have successfully implemented Clojure/ClojureScript web solutions that leverage on these features. - What are the benefits of using a Datalog DB on the client's side?- How do the client and server side databases, the app state, and the communication channel interoperate?- Which parts of the codebase are reusable on the client and the server? (Hint: a lot!)- Key benefits for the system and the team. **Kiran Karkera**Kiran is a Clojure hacker and Data Science professional who’s been programming professionally for 17 years, of which the past 4 years were in Clojure. He now works as Data Scientist at Ocean Protocol. Kiran has contributed to a few Open Source Machine Learning libraries in Clojure. He is also the author of a beginner friendly book on Graphical models, titled “Building Probabilistic Graphical Models in Python”.

Planned Talks : \"Machine Learning for Spoken Dialogue Systems\" - Matthew Henderson Matt's background is in statistical methods for conversational language understanding. He leads the Singapore branch of PolyAI, a spin-out from Steve Young's lab at Cambridge University where he did his PhD. PolyAI is building a machine learning platform for spoken dialogue.After his PhD, he worked on neural network methods for speech synthesis with Heiga Zen at Google Research London, before moving to Ray Kurzweil's language understanding group at Google Research in Mountain View. There he was technical lead for the Smart Reply research team, inventing a new method of modelling email response suggestion that allowed scaling the feature from Inbox to all of GMail. He was the principal data scientist at Carousell, where he launched image caption and category suggestion, chat reply and question answering features. (https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-henderson-9a10b125/ ) \"Sequence to Sequence Model Advances\" - Hardeep Arora This talk outlines how the way in which Deep Learning can be applied to language processing tasks such as language translation, and how the techniques have quickly evolved over the last few years. Hardeep is a Principal Director with Accenture’s Finance &amp; Risk Services based in Singapore and is currently Heading the AI/Analytics Center Of Excellence. He has over 18 years experience with financial companies in Asia Pacific region. Outside work he is active on Google’s Kaggle ML platform and is in top 2% of Data Scientist on Kaggle world wide. He holds a MBA Finance from XLRI and a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. \"The Rise of the Language Model\" - Martin Andrews This talk will explain a major current trend in Natural Language Processing : the increasing focus on using pre-built 'pure' language models (such as ELMO or the model recently announced by OpenAI), and then fine-tuning the output to suit your application. Martin will explain how this works, and you can create better models for your data, leveraging the models created on other, huge datasets by Google / OpenAI / Facebook / etc. --- Other talks for this month's event are currently being finalized : If you have something that you'd like to present in a welcoming environment, please let us know by suggesting yourself below... --- Talks will start at 7pm (A/V equipment permitting) and end at around 9pm, at which point people normally come up to the front for a bit of a chat with each other, and the speakers. --- As always, we're actively looking for more speakers for future events - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks. For the lightning talks, we welcome folks to come and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (so, if you have slides, then #max=10). We believe that the key ingredient for the success of a Lightning Talk is simply the cool/interesting factor. It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

However, building a smart, connected product is complex as it requires the integration of various technical elements such as sensors, electromechanical actuators, microprocessors, communications networks and data analytics platforms. In designing an IoT solution, one also needs to take into account a host of considerations such as interoperability between disparate systems, data security, user privacy, product scalability and total cost of ownership. In this Techspresso talk, Aditi Gupta will address these challenges by sharing her extensive knowledge in solution design garnered from working on a wide range of IoT projects. Aditi is a Solution Architect with hands-on experience in designing and implementing large scale and complex Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Machine-to-Machine (M2M) projects . She currently works at NCS as Lead Consultant.  \n\n\n************************************************************ DATE &amp; AGENDA: Thursday, 10th Nov 2016 • 06:00 pm – Registration &amp; Networking  • 06:45 pm – Introduction  • 07:00 pm – Expert Talk by Aditi • 08:15 pm - QnA  • 08:30 pm - Networking continued ************************************************************  VENUE: NUS Enterprise@Blk71, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #02-01, SG139951 ************************************************************  ************************************************************  Note: Please note that photography and videography will be carried out throughout the event.  IoT SG, Event Sponsors, Supporters may use some or all of these images in its print publications, digital, social platforms and/or marketing channels. We also ask some personal information and questions during registration.

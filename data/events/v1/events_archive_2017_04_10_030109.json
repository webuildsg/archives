She would be talking aboutneed for Business Agility and Adaptive Leadership for enterprise transformation! Please RSVP on Meetup with your Name, Company and Nationality. This event is free. PROGRAM • 6:30 pm Welcome networking with refreshments • 7:00 pm Presentation followed by Q&amp;A SUMMARY The need for agility has never been more pronounced. In today’s dynamic and fast-moving world, some of the biggest companies that exist today didn’t exist five years ago. Some of the biggest brands have been disrupted to the point of extinction. The tools that served us well in the past don’t necessarily still apply – volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity are challenging much of what we know. People at every level in today’s organisations need to focus on customer delight, and bring innovation and continuous learning into our work. This requires us to shed our old practices that are holding us back, and to harness agility to re-imagine the future of our organisations. ABOUT THE PRESENTER: PAT REED This session is presented by Pat Reed, an Agile transformational leader in Adaptive Leadership and Value Innovation. Pat Reed is an experienced Agile executive, coach, transformational leader and adjunct professor at UC Berkley.

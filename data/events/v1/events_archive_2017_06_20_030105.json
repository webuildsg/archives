I'd like to find out what I can do to help developers more often choose to use MongoDB with Rails. Can I build tools to help you migrate data? Can I provide a connector that allows you to convert SQL queries to MongoDB queries? Should I make the query DSL totally different from that of ActiveRecord and more similar to MongoDB's JSON-like query language? I invite you to openly confess your MongoDB opinions to help me provide better support for the Rails community in this brief two-way presentation.\"","location":"Spacemob, #03-01, 8 Claymore Hill, Singapore 229572","rsvp_count":77,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group/events/239950314/","group_id":3952812,"group_name":"Singapore Ruby Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Ruby-Group","formatted_time":"20 Jun 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-20T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.307712,"longitude":103.831764},{"id":"240521034","name":"talk.js - June","description":"This is talk.js -- a monthly meet up for all things JavaScript, Node.js, and the modern web.

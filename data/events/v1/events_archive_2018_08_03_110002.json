Use cases include process automation, data acquisition and testing of applications. Key features of the tool include cross-platform implementation (macOS, Linux, Windows), integration with R &amp; Python for big data and AI use cases, execution of automation flows in 20+ human languages or JavaScript, and visual automation with OCR support. WORKSHOP OBJECTIVEConceptually gain understanding of what RPA is all about, opportunities and challenges offered by RPA, current RPA technology landscape and where it is heading. Technically experience for yourselves RPA in action using TagUI open-source RPA software which is freely available for use without cost. TARGET AUDIENCEPeople with interests in digital transformation, process improvement, engineering etc. Ideally you would have already heard about RPA (Robotic Process Automation) or Intelligent Automation. Technical experience is not mandatory, though attendees with coding experience can try more stuffs.

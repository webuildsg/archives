You will also find out what you can expect at the Learning Innovation Challenge weekend, and meet fellow learners with whom to form teams for the Challenge.\n\nChallenges\nThe way we learn is continually evolving, as new technologies enable exciting new ways of learning, and the requirements of learners and their organisations expand to match them. \nWhat we have to be mindful of, is the “why” of learning. We will need to strike a balance between the learner’s intrinsic motivation based in joy of learning, and the external factors of necessity. We need a more agile, blended approach enabled by technology to harness the power of internal motivation and curiosity - an approach that will fuse learning to work with working to learn.\nThe Civil Service College plays a key role in preparing Singapore’s Public Service to be ready to take on increasingly complex challenges of this world. Hence, as it shapes the learning culture of the Public Service, the College looks to continue transformation of how it delivers and enables learning, by seeking solutions to the following challenges:\nUnderstanding what Learners need or want:\n\n\nHow might we better assess workplace learning needs for individual Learners?\n\n\nHow might we better design learning interventions and content by engaging with Learners and collecting and utilising data on their learning?\n\n\nLearning as an “omni-channel” experience:\n\n\nHow might we use new technologies to create refreshing, engaging learning experiences?\n\n\nHow might we provide a “sandbox” for people to tackle their own business challenges and later, transfer their skills and knowledge to the workplace?\n\n\nExtending beyond the programme:\n\n\n\nHow might we enable continued peer-to-peer learning and foster learning communities across the whole of Government?\n\n\nLearn more about the challenges here.\n\nAlso, don’t forget to check out the Learning Innovation Challenge (30 June - 1 July), where you can collaborate with innovators from different backgrounds and together create solutions that will help public servants make the most of the Future of Learning!\nIf you have any questions, please send us an email at hello@upsingapore.com.

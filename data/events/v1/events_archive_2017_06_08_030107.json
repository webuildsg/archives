Abstract Spring 5 is almost here! One of the most exciting introductions in this release is support for reactive programming, building on the Pivotal Reactor project to support message-driven, elastic, resilient and responsive services. Spring 5 integrates an MVC-like component model adapted to support reactive processing and a new type of web endpoint, functional reactive endpoints.  In this talk, we'll look at the net-new Netty-based web runtime, how existing Servlet code can run on the new world, and how to integrate it with existing Spring-stack technologies.  Programme  6.30pm - 7.00pm  Registration and Pizzas 7.00pm - 7.20pm  CI That Scales With Your Project 7.20pm - 9.00pm  Josh Long - Reactive Spring  Venue Paypal Office @ Suntec Tower Five5 Temasek Blvd, #09-01 Suntec Tower Five, Singapore[masked]Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line) In order for us to clear building security, please help to fill up this form after you RSVP on meetup.

There is no rock star in collaborative design, that the best design can be crafted by the collaborative effort.  This meetup, I'll be inviting two unique, talented designers - Chinwei Wong, a Chemistry major now working as a Product Designer at a startup in the Silicon Valley and Anthony Tham, an Executive Creative Director specialising in Neuroscience Advertising - to tell their stories. As consumers ourselves we would like to think our decisions are entirely rational, at least most of the time. Anthony will talk about how our unconscious desires impact our decisions to buy. Chinwei will share his experience living, working and designing in San Francisco. Agenda:  • Opening Intro - Julee, Organiser of Design Bootcamp Asia • Adding Neuroscience to Magic - Anthony Tham, Executive Creative Director of Hogarth  • Journey from Chemistry to Design - Chinwei Wong, Incoming Product Designer at Boomerang Commerce, based in Silicon Valley.  • Q&amp;A and Dialogue • Network time :) Please bring your friends, and colleagues, and have them join this meetup first and RSVP! \n\n\nSpeaker Bio:  Anthony Tham is the Executive Creative Director at Hogarth. Born Gen-Y, but with the skillset of a Digital Native. During his 15 years in the advertising industry across ASEAN and Greater China, he had amassed experiences on clients across categories such as banking, government, telecommunications, FMCG, fashion and health. For the past five years, he had been on a ludicrous mission to fuse “magic with science”—by combining behavioural science with advertising, especially in the digital interconnected world. \n\n\n Chin Wei is an incoming product designer at Boomerang Commerce, based in Mountain View, California. He graduated with a Masters in Human-Computer Interaction from Carnegie Mellon, and in a previous life built web experiences for clients regionally and further abroad.","location":"WPP Building, 50 Scotts Road, Training Room, Ground Floor, Singapore 228242","rsvp_count":57,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Design-Bootcamp-Asia/events/240417459/","group_id":19617994,"group_name":"Design Bootcamp Asia","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Design-Bootcamp-Asia","formatted_time":"08 Jun 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-06-08T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-06-08T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup"}]}

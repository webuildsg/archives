He made some of the most popular apps in Singapore—SG Buses and SG NextBus. Junjie pays attention to how things work, how fast and how easy a user can do something. His own app and foray into app development—Due—was featured on Daring Fireball. ​After many sessions of badminton and bubble tea, they founded Clean Shaven Apps in June 2012.

I am excited to announce the meetup for July. \n\nThere are two talks scheduled : \n\n1. Hunter Nield will discuss Storage and Stateful Apps on Kubernetes 2. Zumata will discuss their experiences running Kubernetes on GKE.  Storage and Stateful Apps in Kubernetes by Hunter Nield. “Can I run a Database in Kubernetes?” - the most frequently asked question after learning the basics of Kubernetes is how to store data for Stateful Applications.  This talk will introduce concepts around Volumes and the various storage back-ends available.  We will wrap up the talk with a demonstration on how to run a typical Database backed application.  \n\n\nZumata experiences running on GKE by Zumata.  Zumata will present a simple walk through on bringing up a cluster on GKE with Zumata's experiences on pitfalls &amp; what not to do to avoid them. The presentation will include creating pods &amp; the different components of Kubernetes and showcase the capabilities GKE has to offer.

We also have a sister event this month with our PyTorch Meetup. It is aimed a little more at the advanced end of Deep Learning talks. So if you are deep into Deep Learning then its probably worth you checking out.  And, as always, we're actively looking for more speakers - both '30 minutes long-form', and lightning talks where we welcome folks to come up and talk about something cool they've done with TensorFlow and/or Deep Learning for 5-10mins (if you have slides, then #max=10). The key for the Lightning Talks slot is simply the cool/interesting factor.  It doesn't matter whether you're an expert or and enthusiastic beginner: Given the responses we have had, we're sure there are lots of people who would be interested to hear what you've been playing with.

At this stage of their journey, they have documented more than 20 labs in India, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nIn this evening of design & ideation, we'll be spending time exploring the question: \n\nWhat systems and infrastructure are needed to support the growth of the maker movement as a a truly globally distributed community?\n\nWe'll be looking at issues of trust, values, economic transactions and collaboration among others. MakerTour will also be discussing this topic during FAB13 in Santiago de Chile. Powerful insights from this session could be shared at this global event. \n\nLight refreshments will be provided.

Limited capacity.\n\nIn Charting the Multiverse of Our Dreams, performance collective Lalu Lalang Laboratory (L3) explores ideas of genesis, cosmological cycles and alternative futures, interweaving personal journeys that are entwined with their artistic practices. Impromptu play and extemporaneous divertissement play out in a dialogue of poetry and science, through vignettes of sound, dance and projection. \n\nA multitude of focal points all coming together at once, this new synergy of ideas and energies will manifest in a provocative experiment. You are invited to participate by making playful decisions as consumers of the arts.\n\nAbout Lalu Lalang Laboratory (L3):\nL3 started meeting in the spring of 2016 to exchange, encounter, seek, investigate and question the journey of creative existence. The lab marks the rigour, commitment and curiosities of four established artists –Aaron Khek (choreographer/dancer), Leslie Tan (cellist), Nirmala Seshadri (multidisciplinary artist/choreographer) and Ix Wong Thien Pau (choreographer/dancer). Their attitude and approach towards art making is borderless, sans hierarchies and labels. \n\nL3 is open to all like-minded artists. They sit, have tea, and jam. For this jaunt, L3 is joined by guest collaborators Mervin Wong, Swedha Rajaram and Gavin Yap.\n\nLalu Lalang Laboratory #ArtScienceLate","location":"ArtScience Museum, 10 Bayfront Avenue, Singapore 018956","rsvp_count":93,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/394977380896424","group_id":"156726297714355","group_name":"ArtScience Museum","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/156726297714355","formatted_time":"20 Jul 2017, Thu, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-07-20T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-07-20T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.2862681050961,"longitude":103.85934988513},{"id":"240748419","name":"Technical insight 20 JULY","description":"NOTICE THE DATE CHANGE 18-&gt;20 JULY!

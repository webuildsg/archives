You’ll learn what can be considered effective and ineffective definitions of these concepts, and the tools that can help in this process. Also, we’ll discuss how the team can have a shared understanding of what it means to be “done”.\n\nIf you’re working in engineering, product management, or just in defining and delivering products, you should come and join our talk!

Over the last year it has however been met with strong opposition. Recently ASICBOOST, an optimization against the Bitcoin mining algorithm, was confirmed to be implemented in Bitmain's mining chips. This optimization would be only of limited use after SegWit activates.  In this meetup, TenX CEO Toby Hoenisch will explain how Segregated Witness works and describe the conflict with ASICBOOST. Followed up by an open discussion on how this conflict can be resolved and how the Bitcoin community can move forward. The presentation will be followed by networking. ","location":"Paypal at Suntec , 5 Temasek Blvd, #07-01 Suntec Tower Five, Nearest Mrt:Promenade(Yellow Line), Singapore","rsvp_count":52,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore/events/239317300/","group_id":8103652,"group_name":"Bitcoins in Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/BitcoinSingapore","formatted_time":"25 Apr 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-04-25T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-04-25T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.2945,"longitude":103.857964},{"id":"239105400","name":"April Ruby Meetup","description":"Hi fellow Rubyists!  Come join us for our April 2017 Ruby meetup at Spacemob, 8 Claymore Hill, #03-01, Singapore 229572 Programme 1. \"Code review: do we do it right?\" - Mykola Kyryk 2. \"Building a Narrative Bot\" - Tan Guo Xiang 3. \"5 Random Ruby Tips\" - Ashley Huang 4.

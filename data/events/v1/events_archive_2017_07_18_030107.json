Nights: Property Based Testing","description":" \n\n\nIn collaboration with YOW! Conferences we're pleased to announce a YOW! Night Singapore with Charles O'Farrell, talking about Property Based Testing - Finding More Bugs with Less Effort. Please don't RSVP on Meetup, but register for this free event at: https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/yow-night-2017-singapore-charles-ofarrell-july-18-tickets-35681475253  Summary: Testing is an essential part of writing and maintaining correct and reliable software. However, for the most part the best technique we have for writing tests is to capture some examples in the hope that they cover all the known edge cases. Unfortunately these examples almost always missing something. What if we could ask the computer to generate these examples? Not just a handful, but hundreds of them that we never even considered. It turns out we can! By using the technique known as Property Based Testing. This talk will explore the motivation and concepts behind this powerful testing technique. We also introduce a number of simple but useful patterns that can be applied again and again when writing properties. In addition this talk will highlight a handful of compelling examples of Property Based Testing uncovering nasty bugs in real world software. Finally, apart from learning about why and how to use Property Based Testing to write better software, the audience will also realise that testing can be made more enjoyable in the process. \n\n\nPresenter(s):  Charles O'Farrell is a Software Engineer at Ambiata. He cares about correct and reliable software, and is still learning about it every day. Believes that Property Based Testing is an essential tool for writing good software. \n\n\nSponsor(s):  Thanks to ThoughtWorks for sponsoring the YOW!

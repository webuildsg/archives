BYO food, BYO drinks/booze. \n\nSome of us might be pooling money together to buy the usual Christmassy meat, ham and wine. If you're feeling lazy, just chip in around $30 to the pot, and we'll settle the noms. (And don't worry too much about it!)\n\nFrom what we've seen, the tech community has the amazing ability to conjure fun out of just being together. We'll have the nerf guns, drones and [insert flavour-of-the-month game here ðŸ˜‰] as catalysts!\n\nCome one, come all. Let's have a great festive celebration together! â›„\n\n(Santa may or may not show up this year.

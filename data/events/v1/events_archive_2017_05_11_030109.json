While Blockchain is a shared ledger technology, IoT is a concept of connected solutions. In this session we will discuss how Blockchain will enable the realization of many IoT solutions. Speakers  Nikolay Vlasov, Senior Consultant, IBM Cloud (Blockchain Garage Team) During this session we will explore the topic of using blockchain technology for Internet of Things solutions. After a quick overview of key characteristics of blockchain we will discuss how those will help to increase security and transparency of IoT-enabled business processes in comparison with other distributed database systems. As an example we will explore one of the projects that has been done in IBM Blockchain Garage in Singapore and then will take a glimpse into a possible future directions for blockchain and IoT.  Kevin Lim, Cofounder, Freshturf During this session Kevin will share Freshturf’s journey as an IoT startup which took up a challenge to address the last mile delivery services using Blockchain + IoT. FreshTurf is a startup in Singapore that wanted to apply new technology to track delivery shipments, with dedicated storage lockers linked up through a distributed ledger platform. The company’s goal was to provide a “last mile” solution for consumers looking to keep track of their packages more easily and pick up their packages at a remote site. ************************************************************  DATE &amp; AGENDA: Thursday, 11th May 2017 • 06:30 pm – Registration &amp; Networking • 06:50 pm – Introduction by CK  • 07:00 pm – Talk by Nikolay Vlasov • 07:40 pm – Talk by Kevin Lim • 08:20 pm –  QnA  • 08:30 pm - Networking continued ************************************************************  VENUE: NUS Enterprise@Blk71, 71 Ayer Rajah Crescent #02-01, SG139951 ************************************************************  Note: Please note that photography and videography will be carried out throughout the event.  IoT SG, Event Sponsors, Supporters may use some or all of these images in its print publications, digital, social platforms and/or marketing channels. We also ask some personal information and questions during registration.

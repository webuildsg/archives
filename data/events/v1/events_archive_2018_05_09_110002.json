This data of the people and by the people is the most important economic resource of the twenty-first century, as important as oil. And as with oil, the real value comes from refining that raw material – whether at giant multinationals like Google, Facebook, and Amazon or smaller outfits developing techniques to identify shopping habits, job productivity, or wellbeing from our digital traces.\nThe talk will show that it's misguided to fight for a naive conception of privacy or anonymity; that would mean giving up many of the products and services you've come to depend on. Instead, you must take an active role in extracting value from your data, especially as more data comes from social networks and sensors. To ensure your data is being used for you and not against you, you must demand a seat at the controls of the data refineries.\nThe speaker argues that every refinery should provide you with a data \"hygiene\" dashboard -- including measures of expected risk and return on data shared. He outlines five tools that reward data creators with more decision-making power: the right to export data, the right to amend data, the right to blur data, the ability to \"dial\" personalization up and down, and the ability to see how changing inputs affects outputs. \nSpeaker: Andreas Weigend\nweigend.com/ofa \nAndreas Weigend researches the future of big data, social-mobile technologies, and consumer behavior. He studies people and the data they create. He advises companies that want to embrace the new reality of social data. Together, they design interactive platforms and real-time systems that empower them and their customers to make better decisions. As Amazon's chief scientist, he helped create the firm's data strategy and customer-centric culture. Andreas Weigend teaches at Stanford University and UC Berkeley, where he directs the Social Data Lab, and speaks at corporate events and top conferences around the globe. He received his Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford University after studying in Germany and Cambridge, UK. He lives in San Francisco and Shanghai.","location":"Value Lab Asia, Singapore-ETH Centre, #06-01, CREATE Tower, 1 Create Way, Singapore 138602","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/fcl-lunch-talk-transforming-big-data-into-big-decisions-tickets-45846009649?aff=ebapi","group_id":"17260566074","group_name":"Future Cities Laboratory","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/future-cities-laboratory-17260566074","formatted_time":"09 May 2018, Wed, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2018-05-09T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-05-09T05:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"43080215083","name":"Create Video On-The-Go with iMovie iOS Workshop","description":"Love shooting videos while traveling?

It's been a while since we last got together and there's been lots happening with Drupal 8. So, I propose we get back into our regular monthly meetups with one on Monday, October 24 at SmartSpace. Sorry, it's a bit rushed but my calendar is pretty packed these days.  The topic will be: \"Creating and Modifying Forms in Drupal 8\". This is an intermediate level topic for site-builders and developers where I'll explain how to programatically create a form in Drupal 8 using the new FormBase class and how to modify an existing form using the familiar hook_form_alter() function found in previous Drupal versions. After the talk, we'll propose some additional topics for future meetups. Please come prepared with your own topic ideas you like to hear or, even better, speak about. Here are a few of my ideas to get you thinking. - Why Drupal is still relevant- Behat in Drupal 8- Creating a content repository- Drupal DevOps We're not going to provide food or drinks this time since organizing it (and cleaning up afterwards) is time-consuming and seems to be one of the reasons we got tired of planning the meetups. So, we'll keep it simple and just focused on Drupal. But, feel free to bring snacks and drinks for yourself and for sharing! As always, we'll convene downstairs at the food court for dinner, drinks and conversations after the meetup. Looking forward to seeing you all on the 24th. Joe.","location":"SmartSpace, 261 Waterloo Street, #03-32, Singapore 180261","rsvp_count":8,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Drupal-SG/events/234826208/","group_id":1653716,"group_name":"Drupal Developer Network (Singapore)","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Drupal-SG","formatted_time":"24 Oct 2016, Mon, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-10-24T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-24T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.298496,"longitude":103.851494},{"id":"234190669","name":"Practical Data Science at Honestbee","description":"Hi all!

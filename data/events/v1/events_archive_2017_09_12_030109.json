Venue Metro roomLobby, Ascent2 Science Park DriveSingapore 118222 Synopsis Modelling and Analytics in Population Health The population health modelling group within SSHSPH has developed an individual based simulation model that can represent each individual in the resident population over their lifetime and track theirs, and the population’s, aging and onset of chronic diseases like diabetes. This individual based framework allows complex dynamics of risk factors and diseases to be accounted for and in silica trials of programmes to reduce this impact, serving as a virtual test bed for campaigns in the war on diabetes. Computational models are helpful to investigate the spread of infectious diseases in human populations too. Incorporating spatial data in these models allows us to study the geographical-related exposures for vector-borne diseases such as Zika and Dengue. Speakers - Associate Professor Alex Cook leads the modelling group in the Biostatistics and Modelling Domain in the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. He obtained his PhD in statistics and mathematical modelling at Heriot-Watt University. Subsequently, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the Gibson and Gilligan labs at Heriot-Watt and Cambridge, respectively. Associate Prof Cook is best known for his research in computational statistics and modelling in the fields of infectious disease epidemiology, public health and the environment. - Kiesha Prem is a Research Assistant at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, where she does modelling work with the Biostatistics and Modelling Domain. She trained at the Department of Statistics at the National University of Singapore where she obtained her BSc. (Hons) in Statistics. Currently, Kiesha is a PhD candidate with Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Her research interests is in infectious disease modelling using Bayesian statistics.

Every Token ID will have its own cap of tokens available/created, its own valuation - based on the property that is backing it, and its own track record (of price movements, rental income/dividend, and so on). REIDAO aims to democratise property opportunities, to be accessible by everyone, wherever they are. By buying and selling these tokens, you are - in a way - buying and selling fractions of the underlying property. They have essentially created a structure including Public Trust Company to create the link between the tokens and the actual properties. REIDA's vision is to have a Property Tokens Exchange Board, just like a stock exchange, where it will list all the available property tokens globally that has been tokenised. Visit http://www.reidao.io/ for more information  About the speaker: Darvin is the co-founder of REIDAO, a Singapore-based startup creating digital assets that represent real estate. Having been personally exposed to problems in real estate opportunities, Darvin believes the recent advancements in blockchain technologies will be able to solve them and more.

We are extremely excited to have world-renowned Spring Developer Advocate, Java Champion, author and open source contributor, Josh Long speak on Bootiful Testing. We promise you a great night of fun-filled coding and testing with Josh.  Abstract - Bootiful TestingHow would you feel if you knew that any part of the code was at most a few minutes away from being shippable and delivered into production? How would you feel if you knew that any part of the code is a few ctrl+z's away from being shippable and delivered into production? Emboldened and confident?  Test driven development (TDD) gives you that. TDD allows you to proceed with confidence that you're building the right thing. It provides you with imminent-horizons that you can meet and measure. TDD gives developers the confidence to go faster, secure in the knowledge that what they break they will fix and be able to improve.  In this talk, join Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman) as he looks at how to test Spring applications and services. We'll look at how to test basic components, mocks, how to take advantage of test slices, and how to test web applications. We'll also look at how to ensure that API producers and API consumers work well together using consumer driven contract testing (CDCT) without sacrificing the testing pyramid for end-to-end integration tests.

The air temperature and humidity around your body is hot - over 30 °C and 75% relative humidity. This outdoor space is not air-conditioned, nor is it ventilated by a fan. Yet, as you stand in this space you begin to feel an unexpected sensation of cooling down. You touch the surfaces around you, and search for a source of cooling, but exposed surfaces feel little different than the hot ambient environment. What becomes even more bewildering is that, after a few minutes in this space, even though the air temperature hasn’t changed, you begin to feel properly cold… outside.. in Singapore… in the middle of the day.\nThis presentation will introduce “The Cold Tube”, an InterCREATE Seed Project that is exploring new applications of selective materials for radiant cooling in tropical climates. It involves studying the use of infrared-transparent membranes that allow one’s body to “see” actively chilled surfaces hidden behind them, yet are sufficiently separated from these surfaces to avoid condensation. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how this new, energy-efficient technology might provide outdoor thermal comfort in Singapore, without air-conditioning. \nSpeaker: Eric Teitelbaum\nEric is a Ph.D. candidate in Princeton University’s School of Architecture Energy and Computation program. His research combines fundamental materials science with thermal comfort in architectural forms, examining new thermodynamic and materials approaches to latent cooling and radiant systems, spanning desiccant dehumidification and M-Cycle evaporative cooling to expanded psychrometric models for thermal comfort. He will begin leading the deployment of the ColdTube outdoor pavilion in July 2018, a project that negotiates the marriage between radiant heat transfer and formal architectural constraints to demonstrate thermal comfort through radiant cooling outdoors in Singapore, 20 °C below the dew point without condensation. ","location":"Value Lab Asia, Singapore-ETH Centre, #06-01, CREATE Tower, 1 Create Way, Singapore 138602","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/fcl-lunch-talk-actively-cooling-singapore-using-radiation-the-coldtube-project-tickets-46352455442?aff=ebapi","group_id":"17260566074","group_name":"Future Cities Laboratory","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/future-cities-laboratory-17260566074","formatted_time":"30 May 2018, Wed, 12:00 pm","start_time":"2018-05-30T04:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-05-30T05:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"251102767","name":"Made In Singapore: Aerospace Excellence","description":"Please register at http://sginnovate.com/events/made-singapore-aerospace-excellence.

In order to do that, you need to learn new things. Leaving your comfort zone is a good way to learn new things, but during this NightClazz, you'll be able to stay where you \"think\" your comfort zone is. \"Think\" because, actually, Xavier is going to push you out of your comfort zone from there :) You will code some small coding exercises (45 minutes each) a.k.a.. katas but with strong (and a bit crazy) constraints. We promise, you won't stay within your comfort zone, you will learn a lot and you will have a lot of fun! The only prerequisites is to have a computer and a development environment ready on it. There is absolutely no constraint whatsoever about the language you'll use even if I recommend you to use one you're familiar with (your comfort zone :) ). Xavier Detant is co-organiser of the Software Craftsmanship Community of Paris and the SoCraTes France Unconference. Knowledge sharing is at the heart of his mindset. In love with functional programming and beautiful code, enjoying doing and explaining code made him a passionate crafter.

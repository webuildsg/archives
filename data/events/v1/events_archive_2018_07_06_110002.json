To register your attendence, kindly use this registration page - https://www.aisingapore.org/event/tagui-open-source-rpa-workshop-3 WORKSHOP OVERVIEWAI Singapore maintains and develops TagUI – a Robotic Process Automation (RPA) software that can be used for automating user interactions with web browsers and other applications. Use cases include process automation, data acquisition and testing of applications. Key features of the tool include cross-platform implementation (macOS, Linux, Windows), integration with R &amp; Python for big data and AI use cases, execution of automation flows in 20+ human languages or JavaScript, and visual automation with OCR support. WORKSHOP OBJECTIVEConceptually gain understanding of what RPA is all about, opportunities and challenges offered by RPA, current RPA technology landscape and where it is heading. Technically experience for yourselves RPA in action using TagUI open-source RPA software which is freely available for use without cost. TARGET AUDIENCEPeople with interests in digital transformation, process improvement, engineering etc. Ideally you would have already heard about RPA (Robotic Process Automation) or Intelligent Automation. Technical experience is not mandatory, though attendees with coding experience can try more stuffs. NOTE - please bring along your laptop (macOS, Linux, Windows) for this hands-on session","location":"AI Singapore @ innovation 4.0, 3 Research Link, Singapore 117602","rsvp_count":3,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-RPA/events/252354279/","group_id":28518475,"group_name":"Singapore RPA","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-RPA","formatted_time":"06 Jul 2018, Fri, 2:00 pm","start_time":"2018-07-06T06:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-07-06T09:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.294636,"longitude":103.775566},{"id":"252422464","name":"Building Better AI for Singapore","description":"Please register here, https://www.sginnovate.com/events/building-better-ai-singapore Building Better AI for Singapore Presented by SGInnovate.

While almost all methods used are based on the Navier-Stokes equations, the discretisation methods for the water surface differ widely. Many of these highly different methods are being used with success.\n One of these methods that is being used in industrial practice: the surface capturing with Volume-of-Fluid in the FINE™/Marine developed by NUMECA and CNRS/Ecole Centrale de Nantes is presented here, by describing in detail its implementation. The main topic of this part is the compressive flux discretisation schemes for the volume fraction that are used in this code. Then the advanced efficient technologies are implemented to ensure the highest accuracy of the results. Among others will be highlighted:\n\nFull-hex high quality mesh generation both structured and unstructured approaches and automatic\nAdaptive grid refinement AGR\nOverset with AGR ensuring continuity between background and foreground domains\nUncertainty Quantification\nAutomated Optimization System in from parametric modeler, mesh generator, CFD solver, database and surrogate modeling involving AI, advanced optimization algorithms, RDO (Robust Design Optimization) and efficient data-mining post-processor.\n\n After showing its validations for Cargo Vessels & Cruise Ships, Motor Yachts & High Speed Crafts, Sailing Yachts, Propulsion, Wind effects, Seakeeping, brief examples of optimization are given of its use in 2 different applications: large ferry hull and propeller.\n Content of Program\n\nIntroduction to NUMECA and FINE/Marine\nOverview of CFD for Marine Applications\nDiscretisation Methods for Free Surface Flows\nSimulating Fluid-Structure Interaction \nSome Applications on Marine Vessels and Structures\n\n\nAbout the Speaker\nDr. Aji Purwanto\nGraduated from ISAE – Institut Supérieure Aeronatique et Espace, the French High Engineering School for Aerospace, in Toulouse, France and INPT in Master Aerospace Engineering and a PhD in Turbulence Modeling in 1994, he has wide experience in aerospace industry and academic functions. He was R&D engineers and scientists at Airbus, SAFRAN – SNECMA, Indonesia Aerospace Inc., and as research scientist at ENSICA-ISAE, he was also lecturer at several French “Grandes Ecoles”: ISAE (Ensica & SupAero) and ENAC. His domain of interests covers CFD, turbulence modelling, turbomachinery, marine CFD, and sales & marketing in Industrial CFD.

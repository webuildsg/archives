This is a paid workshop.¬†Please register at https://ti.to/reddotruby/rdrc2017-workshop-dry-rb/ ¬†¬†Only 24 slots available!¬† This workshop is one of the fringe events for RedDotRubyConf 2017, which will be held on 22 &amp; 23 June. Check out the conference¬†here! --- About the Workshop Found yourself tangled up in hard-to-maintain code? Been building app after app in the same way and never finding a way to make significant improvements? Vaunted object-oriented design principles proving too elusive or hard to apply? Thinking maybe it‚Äôs time to leave Ruby (_gasp!_) for something different? If you‚Äôve answered yes to any of these questions, this workshop is for you! Come along and learn how to build a next-generation Ruby web app with dry-rb: an app that is robust, cleanly architected, and just as easy to build now as it will be to maintain later. You‚Äôll discover how to: - Apply functional programming principles to Ruby applications- Model your application as a series of data transformations- Use dependency injection to take simple components and compose them to build larger pieces of functionality- Use strict typing to model your domain data- Validate user input with clarity and precision- Build an explicit persistence API with rom-rb- Use monads to safely manage complex behaviour and improve failure handling- Model complex behaviour as business transactions- Separate high-level application concerns into distinct layers- Write clearer, faster tests for all parts of an application Then you‚Äôll put these concepts to use in building your own application with dry-rb! At the end of the day, you‚Äôll have made some real steps towards levelling up as a software developer. You‚Äôll have explored a different paradigm in application design, practiced working with many new gems (15 at last count!), and hopefully found a new enthusiasm for Ruby and how you can wield it to write better, cleaner code. This workshop is intended for developers with some experience working with Ruby. You‚Äôll need to bring your own laptop, with a working installation of your Ruby development environment. --- About Your Coach  Tim Riley is a partner at Australian design and development agency Icelab, a co-founder and core developer of dry-rb, and a core developer of rom-rb. He‚Äôs been working exclusively with this stack for nearly 2 years, and is excited about advancing the state of web development in Ruby.

Or how they can modify your IPA to unlock or add \"features\" and then redistribute them to normal users? As responsible iOS engineers, it is our duty to protect our users against such malicious exploits. Or can we? In this episode, we will explain and demonstrate common techniques and tools used to inspect and modify an IPA. Specifically, we will cover how to: decrypt a signed IPA, inspect decrypted binary, attach debugger, inject custom code, and repackage the modified binary. We will also talk about some scenarios we encountered during work where we utilized a couple of the described techniques to solve our problems. Speaker Andrew Eng Andrew is the iOS team lead in Labs, Sea with 4 years of experience in iOS development. He sometimes dismantles iOS apps and eats them for breakfast.

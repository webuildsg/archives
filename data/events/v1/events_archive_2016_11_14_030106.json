Teams of students from the best Data Science programs around the world are expected to compete over a “real-world” problem. A first qualifier phase of the competition took place online in June. The 20 best teams were invited for the final phase of the competition, which took place in Paris in September.  The qualifier phase was a image classification challenge and 2 teams from Singapore, Data Ninja (NUS) and YNC Hacks (Yale-NUS) managed to clinch the 9th and 17th spot respectively, earning them the spot to represent Singapore in the final phase in Paris. https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/data-science-game-2016-online-selection/leaderboard. The final phase is an insurance quote conversion challenge. They managed to rank 5th and 6th in the final phase, just behind teams from Russia, UK, France and Italy. http://www.datasciencegame.com/leaderboard They will share the approaches they employed in both phases as well as lessons learnt, using both as use cases contrasting deep learning and traditional machine learning techniques. We will also be giving out free books to prize winners!

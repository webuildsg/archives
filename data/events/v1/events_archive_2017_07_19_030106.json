The talk will contain technical details that will explain the architecture and features of OS for remote forensics, ways to overcome challenges of remote user trust, and demo on how to built your own Live OS in minutes. \"Introduction to Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)\" - In this talk, Wai Tuck will talk about an often ignored feature of Nmap, the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) - what it is, how to use it, and how to write your own simple scripts. Wai Tuck will walk through a demo of using Nmap to discover a vulnerability, and then writing a short script to automatically detect for that vulnerability downstream. If we have time, Wai Tuck will run through more complicated scripts, such as smb-vuln-cve[masked] (aka Sambacry). \"Cross-CTF: A Follow-Up on the CTF Scene in Singapore\" - In this talk, Wai Tuck will share about updates to the CTF scene in Singapore and how it has evolved in the past year. This includes the motivation behind running Cross Varsity CTF (previously X-CTF, but now rebranded to CrossCTF) for its second run, as well as the insights the organising team has gained from running the competition. Wai Tuck will also share about the infrastructure and interesting challenges that the team has made for the competition, which includes reverse engineering an Arduino, collecting data from LED exfiltration, binary exploitation, binary patching and reverse engineering.

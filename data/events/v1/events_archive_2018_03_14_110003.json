Use cases include process automation, data acquisition and testing of web apps. ​The intention is to add AI capabilities to TagUI while keeping it open-source and free to use. Key features of the tool include cross-platform implementation (macOS, Linux, Windows), integration with R &amp; Python for big data and AI use cases, execution of automation flows in 20+ human languages or JavaScript, and visual automation with OCR support. WORKSHOP OBJECTIVEConceptually gain understanding of what RPA is all about, opportunities and challenges offered by RPA, current RPA technology landscape and where it is heading. Technically experience for yourselves RPA in action using the TagUI open-source RPA software (for people attending the hands-on, please bring along your own laptops). TARGET AUDIENCEPeople with interests in digital transformation, process improvement, engineering etc. Ideally you would have already heard about RPA (Robotic Process Automation) or Intelligent Automation. Technical experience is not mandatory, though attendees with programming experience will be able to try out more stuffs during the hands-on. PROGRAMME Overview of RPA – 20 minutesBackground, today and future of RPA – introduce what RPA is and how is it different from traditional IT or automation technologies. Elaborate how RPA works and what type of work it can be used to automate.Opportunities and Challenges – discuss why RPA now and the automation opportunities of RPA. Elaborate on both the technical and human challenges faced when trying to deploy RPA.Tools and Implementations – talk about various RPA software market leaders (Blue Prism, Automation Anywhere, UiPath, WorkFusion). Examples of companies currently using RPA. Overview of TagUI – 20 minutesIntro to TagUI – free and open-source process automation software that reads workflows in human language to perform automation. Top 3 open-source automation tools for Google Chrome. TagUI can work on macOS, Linux-based OSes and Windows laptops, unlike commercial RPA software which can only work on Windows.Automation concepts – understanding the concepts for web apps and visual automation. TagUI can also interact with desktop applications using visual recognition. Though applications are increasingly shifting to web-apps instead of traditional thick or thin client-server architectures.Workflows demos – show some sample workflows of automation in action to let attendees get an overview of what is possible using TagUI software, so that they will be able to imagine in their own context what type of processes could be automated. RPA General Q&amp;A – 20 minutes Hands-on Session – 60 minutes(Topics: Setup, Using it, Architecture, Advance Features, Developers Reference) • What to bringIf you are staying for this hands-on session, please bring along your laptop. • Important to knowThis is a 2-parts workshop. First part is non-technical. Second part is a hands-on workshop with the TagUI tool.","location":"AI Singapore, 3 Research Link Singapore 117602","rsvp_count":33,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Singapore-Meetup/events/248467996/","group_id":22704692,"group_name":"Artificial Intelligence Singapore Meetup","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Singapore-Meetup","formatted_time":"14 Mar 2018, Wed, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2018-03-14T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-03-14T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.294636,"longitude":103.775566},{"id":"248463829","name":"Quantum Computing Meetup","description":"• What we'll do Hello Quantumers!

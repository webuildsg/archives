When you hear the term visual analytics, what does that mean to you? Visualising information has become a hot topic for sure. We have meet up groups like these, companies are using it, and schools are teaching it. Visualising for the sake of showing data in a pretty way is how it was traditionally used. During this meetup, let’s have a discussion around using visuals not as the final presentation product, but instead as a tool to understand where to dig deeper by focusing on the curiosity at hand. To make this fun and engaging, we will be doing some live examples to do an exploration of our own! Speaker Bio: After 2 years of working as a Tableau Consultant in Singapore, KJ Kim is now driving Tableau’s Marketing Outreach Programs in Asia Pacific. This means to work with universities and the communities in Asia to approach analytics with the intent to enable everyone, instead of viewing it as something for only the data experts. • What to bringYourself and preferably with a laptop (with Tableau installed is best). Else just come and listen.","location":"The Metro @ thebridge, Level 1, Ascent, 2 Science Park Drive, Singapore","rsvp_count":63,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Data-Vis-Singapore/events/248564494/","group_id":24544511,"group_name":"Data Vis Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Data-Vis-Singapore","formatted_time":"21 Mar 2018, Wed, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2018-03-21T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-03-21T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.290666,"longitude":103.78495},{"id":"42976593147","name":"Capture Every Moment (iPhone & DSLR Photography Workshop)","description":"Technology nowadays have changed the way how we do the things that we were so used to do back then, such as taking photos.\n\nBack in the old days, in order for us to shoot a good and high quality photo, we need a good and high cost camera, or a good editing software to enhance the outcome of our master piece.

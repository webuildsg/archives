With GraphQL, you can define your backend as a well-defined graph-based schema. Then client applications can query your dataset as they are needed. GraphQL’s power comes from a simple idea — instead of defining the structure of responses on the server, the flexibility is given to the client. In this talk, discover a new approach to build and expose Web APIs. Will GraphQL do to REST what REST did to SOAP?\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nYos is a recent Computer Science graduate from NUS SoC, currently working as a software engineer at PayPal. In his spare time, Yos moonlights as an API fanatic and enjoys learning new things.\n\nOur Sponsors\n\nFriday Hacks is sponsored by NUS Enterprise.","location":"The Hangar by NUS Enterprise, , Singapore","rsvp_count":5,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/348978242107994","group_id":"164904410234667","group_name":"NUS Hackers","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/164904410234667","formatted_time":"14 Oct 2016, Fri, 6:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-14T10:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-14T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook"},{"id":"990323507779458","name":"TGIFHacks #55 - Free Blogging w/ GitHub","description":"Dear Hackers,\n\nHi, hope you enjoyed our events last week (Hackware meetup, $PATH to iNTUition, and iNTUition v3.0).

What can we do as fellow volunteers and as volunteer managers to engage our volunteers throughout their journey so that they (and we) remain motivated while the organisations or beneficiaries also get the help they need? Join us for this session of Future Fridays: The Future of Giving where we will use the futures wheel to explore trends that may affect volunteerism in our future. We will also use the volunteer journey map and volunteer archetypes to think about creative and sustainable ways of understanding and motivating our volunteers.\n\nThank you very much to Central Singapore CDC for being our venue partner! \n\n==\n\nOctober is all about the Future of Giving! Sustainable Living Lab and (these)abilities will be examining the trends affecting what motivates volunteers, experimenting with different messages to engage them and exploring how cutting edge technologies can help create strong volunteer relationships. Whether you are a volunteer, a volunteer manager or simply curious, you can’t miss this! At the end of this series, we hope that you will understand and be inspired by the principles behind inclusive design. We also hope that whether you are a volunteer or a volunteer manager you will walk away with a toolkit that will help you to manage volunteer relationships better.\n\nWrite us at chewlin.kay@sl2square.org if you are joining us!","location":"Central Singapore Community Development Council, HDB Hub BizThree, 490 Lorong 6 Toa Payoh, #07-11 (Lobby 2) 310490","rsvp_count":9,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/308157952901140","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"14 Oct 2016, Fri, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-14T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-14T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.3323462666818,"longitude":103.84835425527}]}

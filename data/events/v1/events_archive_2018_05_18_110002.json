Hence, we need to continually evolve the way we learn and acquire skills. We want to encourage peer-to-peer learning, enable organisations to adapt and integrate learning, and invent new ways of tracking and benchmarking.\nWhether you’re an entrepreneur, developer, designer, educator, or student, we want you to become an architect of the Future of Learning. Come co-create with other people who want to do things differently!\nChallenges\nNew and emerging technologies are set to disrupt the way we work. Hence, we need to continually evolve the way we learn and acquire skills. We want to encourage peer-to-peer learning, enable organisations to adapt and integrate learning, and invent new ways of tracking and benchmarking.\n1. Learning as a Community: Shifting away from a traditional classroom model of learning, peer-to-peer and decentralised learning platforms present opportunities for the access to learning through mediums that people use every day.\nThe knowledge exchange creates value by leveraging shared expertise and resources contributed by the community as well as the learner himself or herself. Early adopters can lead with their “pro-sumer” (professional consumer) contributions.\nThe threshold of learning is also reduced – these platforms are easy to join and use through better design (for example, gamification, user interface, etc.).\nHow might we inspire and empower individuals to learn from and with their peers?\n2. Adaptive Organisations: As the demands of the workforce evolve to a culture of growth and engagement with meaningful tasks, organisations are challenged to provide customised – even personalised – training opportunities for their employees.\nThis will require aligning workplace demands with the aspirations, passions, needs, and preferred ways of learning of individuals.\nIndividuals have access to platforms and tools that provide the necessary knowledge “just in time” to perform a specific task or assignment and are flexible enough to overcome the perennial employee complaint – lack of time.\nHow might we enable organisations to adapt and integrate learning, such that the way we work becomes the way we learn?\n3. Track & Benchmark: As we establish new pathways of success, we must also build the appropriate infrastructure to support the ecosystem of individual employees and their organisations, entrepreneurs, and government. For example, with informal learning, a new system to track and reward both contributors and learners will need to be designed.\nNew ways of acknowledging and conferring credentials – supplementing present-day formal accreditation systems – can encourage organisations to hire based on capabilities rather than paper qualifications. It can also promote adaptive accumulation of skills by individuals and help them understand where they are on their path to skills mastery.\nSuch decentralised forms of learning, tracking, and benchmarking can be made possible by new and emerging technologies such as blockchain and AI. Big Data coupled with a Design Thinking mindset enables organisations to continuously experiment, validate, and innovate.\nHow might we motivate and support new ways of learning with tracking and benchmarking tools?\nWhy You Should Join\nLearn: Hear from the experts on the Future of Learning. Build: Collaborate with other innovators on your solution. Pitch: Pitch to industry and government leaders.\nGet Rewarded: Stand to win from a big prize pool of $12,500!\nAlso, don't forget to check out the Pre-Hackathon Workshop (14 May) where we'll have an in-depth discussion of the hackathon challenges with industry experts, and where you can meet like-minded innovators and form your team for the hackathon!\nIf you have any questions, please drop us an email at hello@upsingapore.com.","location":"LEVEL3, Mapletree Business City, 20 Pasir Panjang Road,, East Wing, #03-22/24, Singapore 117439","url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/e/skillsfuture-singapore-hackathon-2018-tickets-45056829189?aff=ebapi","group_id":"3543644077","group_name":"UP Singapore","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.sg/o/up-singapore-3543644077","formatted_time":"19 May 2018, Sat, 9:00 am","start_time":"2018-05-19T01:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2018-05-20T10:00:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"}]}

UX is increasingly important to organisations, but often implemented in a fragmented way. How do we align that vision across every customer touchpoint? Foolproof’s Strategy Director Tim Loo will share real life case studies demonstrating how to create UX strategy to achieve that and more importantly, how to start implementing it in your organisation.  2 half-day workshops will be conducted in #Singapore 29th August, register here - http://ptix.co/2uya0nt There are only 25 spaces per workshop and we expect them to sell out quickly. Workshop 1: How to create a UX Strategy (9AM-12PM) What is UX strategy and how do we create one? In this workshop, we’ll step through our strategy process: • Where are we today? • Where are we trying to get to? • How will we measure success? • What do we need to do? • What's our plan? Since 2010, Foolproof has worked with companies like HSBC, Shell and Sony to devise and embed experience strategy into the designs of customer experiences around the world. You’ll be working with real-life briefs, getting practical advice from Tim’s experience in these projects and learning the impact of each. This workshop is for experience professionals looking to apply more strategic models and thinking to their work: agency consultants, experience designers and strategists, and client-side agents of change such as managers and heads of UX, experience strategy, eCommerce and/or multichannel.  Workshop 2: How to sell UX strategy to your organisation (2:30-5:30PM) You know your organisation needs a strategy, but can’t get the necessary attention and traction. How do you seize the opportunity to gain buy-in and a budget?  In this workshop, Tim will guide you through the process of turning a conversation about design into engaging in UX strategy, with tools and techniques for selling and embedding this into client organisations. You’ll also learn how to win opportunities to do experience strategy work. You’ll then apply these in real-life scenarios, working in groups to identify the strategy gap, find the right sponsor, create a brief and secure a budget. You’ll be drawing from Tim’s experience in these scenarios and learn the impact of each.  This workshop is for anyone working to champion UX strategy or looking to kick off experience strategy initiatives: agency consultants, experience strategists and client-side agents of change such as managers and heads of UX, experience strategy, eCommerce and/or multichannel.  About the facilitator Tim Loo has over 15 years of selling and delivering strategy engagements globally, with brands such as Sony Playstation, Intercontinental Hotels Group and Shell. As Executive Director of Strategy at Foolproof, he leads our strategy and planning practice from London, developing and deploying our strategy framework and expertise across a range of global clients. On top of that, he is a regular speaker on UX strategy in Europe, USA and Asia. *Ticket from Peatix is required to attend this event.  Click here to register.","location":"Huone Events Hotel Singapore, 3D River Valley Road #03-01, 179023","rsvp_count":5,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Foolproof-Singapore/events/242375539/","group_id":25184914,"group_name":"Foolproof Singapore","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Foolproof-Singapore","formatted_time":"29 Aug 2017, Tue, 9:00 am","start_time":"2017-08-29T01:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-29T03:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.289869,"longitude":103.845589},{"id":"242763786","name":"(new!)

Its introduction as the solution to the now outdated SOC model has created a new breed of security professionals – Threat Hunters. People with both offensive and defensive skills who proactively hunt through the unknown for the next APT. This talk aims to continue the discussion around Threat Hunting but also moves onto how to actually become an effective Threat Hunter in 2017. Areas such as skillset, what the role entails day to day and how to hunt for the unknown will be covered based on the best Threat Hunting team in the industry, and their journey since their inception. These different skill areas will then be showcased through a technical case study based on some of the hunts Countercept has carried out over the years, and use them to bring to life a real world attack scenario. This is an unprecedented opportunity for both security professionals and enthusiasts to find out exactly what it takes to be a Threat Hunter, and thereby be introduced to Threat Hunting as a whole. At present, many professionals who hold cyber security roles already have skills and experience which are ready to be leveraged for Threat Hunting within their organisation and thus meet the ever increasing demand for it. Others are interested in pursuing this up and coming role as a new career path. All that remains is for them to be introduced to the core Threat Hunting concepts along with the information they need to prepare themselves adequately. This presentation will cover all the relevant areas needed to address this demand.The world needs more Threat Hunters and you can do something about it. Dev | Sec | Ops to DevSecOps DevOps is gaining large traction in the software development world due to many successful stories of delivering high quality products in shorter time. However traditional security controls and resources are not able to keep up with the speed of DevOps teams, and it is becoming an inhibitor of delivering business value. Thus there is a need to evolve traditional security practices in order to keep pace with the DevOps movement. This talk aims to cover what is DevOps, DevOps practices, and how can we integrate security into it.\" Overcoming laziness - 5 Excuses Thankfulness and happiness - two feelings which developers/sysadmins are unlikely to have for independent security testers. This short session highlights some points for overcoming resistance at the developer/sysadmin level, for further discussion after the talk. Speakers' Bio Hamza is a Threat Hunter for Countercept since its inception in 2015. He joined right after completing hisdegree in Computer Security.

With over 20 years of working experience in Asia, USA and Europe, at present working on his own Startup Komerco which is his attempt to organize global product information for multi-channel commerce. In this endeavor leveraging Python and its excellent libraries. Previously in China while working for arvato systems (part of Bertelsmann, one of the largest media and services group in Europe), he helped many multi-nationals for digital transformation and direct to consumer strategy. He also worked with Bayer in APAC region to launch their sales force effectiveness and customer relationship management program targeting healthcare professionals like doctors, nurses and hospitals. In his current work whenever necessary he leverages machine and deep learning to make decisions. How do I know if the price or rent of house in Singapore is reasonable?I recently moved to a new home. While looking for a home I checked propertyguru.com and 99.co, two most common place to look for buy/sell or rent property in Singapore. But while looking at them I wanted to see if the asking price is in-line with the actual value of the house or not. As URA (Urban Renewal Authority) in Singapore compiles the property transaction data (available as realis paid subscription or free with limited information). Based on this data I thought of writing python prgram to see if can leverage machine learning or deep learning to to train linear regression model using URA data and predict the price based on location and size of the house and compare it with asking price. In this attempt to write the program I trained linear regression model using various algorithms like Elastic Net, Random Forest and linear regression with single layer and multi-layer neural network using tensorflow. Later compared them and then used the model to predict unseen data. In this talk I will walk you through the journey of how I tried doing step by step using jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, scipy, tensorflow, keras, matplotlib. You will see the challenges of handling categorical data for linear regression which prefer numerical data and some of the ways to avoid over-fitting or under-fitting. Consider it like a primer on machine learning for house price/rental prediction for Singapore property transactions. 8pm: Talk #2: Introduction to BeeWare by Paul Lorett AmazonaPaul is a developer who enjoys polyglot development. He uses .NET and Microsoft Dev stack at work. Outside work, he uses other languages such as Python and R for non-profit initiatives and various personal IoT projects. Toga is Python native, OS native GUI toolkit. It allows one to develop an app in Python and deploy it as a native implementation in various platforms. Paul (who recently attended Pycon AU 2017) will be sharing his experience in one if the conference sprints where he contributed to the development of a toga widget. If time allows, he'll demo an app written in python and deployed in a number of platforms (e.g. windows, linux, etc). 8:30pm: Open Announcements:   If you have anything to share with the community, just grab the mic and spread the word :)","location":"Singapore Power, 240 Tanjong Pagar Road #08-00 Singapore 088540 ","rsvp_count":250,"url":"https://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group/events/240986696/","group_id":18417697,"group_name":"Singapore Python User Group","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Python-User-Group","formatted_time":"29 Aug 2017, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2017-08-29T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-08-29T13:00:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.274361,"longitude":103.842773},{"id":"242641037","name":"IxD Session: A conversation with Chooake Wongwattanasilpa, DBS Bank","description":"This August, we'll be having a conversation with Chooake Wongwattanasilpa who leads the User Experience and Design team at DBS Bank Consumer Group regionally.   About Chooake ​​Chooake Wongwattanasilpa, based in Singapore, is the current Executive Director of User Experience and Design at DBS Bank, a role he has held since March 2016.

We will host Jakub Jares (remotely) he will talk about Pester. I am Jakub, I am a one of the owners of the Pester project, and I've been doing testing in PowerShell since before it was cool. I have several years of administrative experience mostly in banking environment, where I discovered Pester and started using it to test my own projects. Two years ago I moved to development, and so I can hopefully offer insight from the admin as well as developer point of view. I am also a Microsoft MVP for the past 3 years. Introduction to Pester. This session will teach you how to start testing with Pester. We will have a look on the basic principles, of automated testing and how to apply them with Pester. We will go through some of the basic errors and and how to avoid them. And we will have a look on how Pester fits in the big picture and how others are using it. Our second session will be about DSC Using scripts and DSC to set up a virtual lab environment. I plan to demo to use a single fresh PC and turn it into a functional virtual LAB with several functional VMs to be used for research or testing. Faster and cheaper than you could do on Azure. I will show various tips and tricks during the demo. Bio: Peter is working with Microsoft technologies since the early 1990s.

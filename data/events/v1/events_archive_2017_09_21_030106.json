Besides relatively well known technologies such as Bluetooth, WiFi and 4G cellular, there are also several emerging low-power networking options such as Sigfox, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT. \nThese low-power wide area network (LPWAN) protocols are an increasingly popular approach for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. They require fewer base stations to effectively cover entire cities and allow connected device batteries to last dramatically longer, thus enabling the deployment of novel and more efficient connected solutions.\nIn this roundtable session, we take a closer look at the unique benefits and constraints of the various LPWAN options. Understand how the requirements of your specific application such as data bandwidth, range, security and battery life will dictate the choice of one or some combination of these networks. You will also learn about the wide range of resources available at NUS to augment and accelerate your connected devices innovation efforts.\nJoin us for lunch on 22-September and get plugged into the dynamic world of IoT data networks. \nProgram:11:30 - Registration12:00 - Overview of emerging IoT data networks by Kelvin Hor of Sigfox12:30 - Introduction to IoT talent, technologies and startups at NUS12:45 - Networking over Lunch","location":"NUS Enterprise @ SSP, 3 Science Park Drive, #01-06/09, The Franklin, Singapore 118223","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/connecting-things-data-networks-powering-the-internet-of-things-registration-37867495699?aff=ebapi","group_id":"10618207779","group_name":"NUS Enterprise","group_url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/o/nus-enterprise-10618207779","formatted_time":"21 Sep 2017, Thu, 11:30 am","start_time":"2017-09-21T03:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2017-09-21T05:30:00.000Z","platform":"eventbrite"},{"id":"243167551","name":"HYBRID CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURES: DEVELOPING OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS TO ACHIEVE YOUR GOALS","description":"In this session, you will discover how our Hybrid Cloud solutions allows you to design ultra-customized IT architecture based on your business requirements across industries.

Topics include: • Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). • Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). • Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).  The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas. This course runs for 11 Weeks – ends in December and requires between 5 and 10 hours of time per week. The course can be taken for free, or for a small fee to Coursera you can have your assignments graded and receive a certificate at the end. Singaporeans are able to claim the course fees with http://www.skillsfuture.sg/. We will be meeting weekly on Thursdays to discuss both lectures and assignments. At each meetup we'll discuss the previous week's lectures and the current assignment. You should have watched the lectures and at least made a start on the assignment, if not completed it. Doors open 7pm. Meetup starts 7:30pm and usually runs to 9:00/9:30pm. Bring dinner/snacks and/or eat beforehand. Press 06160🔔 at the intercom downstairs so we can buzz you in.

Unlike some currently existing implementations of client-side GPGPU, gpu.js does not require browser support through an explicit GPGPU API or an installation of a custom native runtime browser extension to enable such support. This allows the library to run on all modern platforms, including on mobile devices such as smartphones. It achieves this by using the already widely adopted WebGL graphics API in a manner that it is not designed by making use of JavaScript to GLSL transpilation. The library abstracts away all the unnecessary implementation details of awkwardly performing GPGPU on a graphics API and, at the same time, provides an API that was designed specifically for GPGPU. Speaker Fazli Sapuan Fazli enjoys hacking random stuff together in his free time. As a GPU computing and JavaScript enthusiast, Fazli envisioned an easy way to perform GPGPU inside the browser. Thus, working with a few fellow engineers, gpu.js was created so that it could be used to teach parallel computing concepts to beginners. In this talk, Fazli will describe the inner workings of gpu.js and the challenges he faced while working on gpu.js. \n\n\nSchedule 7:00 PM Registration, mingling and Pizza 7:30 PM The Talk 8:30 PM Q &amp; A, and more mingling Our new logo T-shirts and other small perks will be given out upon registration!

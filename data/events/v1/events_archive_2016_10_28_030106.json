See you there!\n\nDate/Time: Friday, October 28 at 6:45pm \nVenue: SR3, Town Plaza, University Town \nFree pizza is served before the talks. \n\nWhy Go For Go!\n\nTalk Description:\n\nThe Go Programming Language - often referred to as GoLang - was launched by Google in 2007. Co-created by Ken Thompson (co-creator of Unix and creator of B, the predecessor to C), Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer, Go has been growing in popularity year-after-year.\n\nWe believe that there are good reasons for Go’s growing popularity and believe you should seriously consider it as the next programming language you learn.\n\nIn this talk, we will cover the benefits provided by Go and why we like it for a range of problem domains, including microservice based architectures.\n\nSpeaker Profile\n\nJordan Dea-Mattson \n\nJordan is the VP of Software Engineering at TradeGecko.

However, planning meaningful opportunities for learning and leadership can be challenging. In this session, we will be exploring how we might as volunteer managers plan opportunities for our volunteers to grow within the organisation, and how we might support our volunteers as their aspirations lead them to start projects of their own. \n\nThank you to Southeast CDC for being our venue partner! \n\n==\n\nOctober is all about the Future of Giving! Sustainable Living Lab and (these)abilities will be examining the trends affecting what motivates volunteers, experimenting with different messages to engage them and exploring how cutting edge technologies can help create strong volunteer relationships. Whether you are a volunteer, a volunteer manager or simply curious, you can’t miss this! At the end of this series, we hope that you will understand and be inspired by the principles behind inclusive design. We also hope that whether you are a volunteer or a volunteer manager you will walk away with a toolkit that will help you to manage volunteer relationships better.\n\nWrite us at chewlin.kay@sl2square.org if you are joining us!","location":"South East CDC - Your Social Broker, 10 Eunos Road 8, #12-01, Singapore Post Centre 408600","rsvp_count":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1842238089341888","group_id":"172727739480818","group_name":"Sustainable Living Lab (SL2)","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/172727739480818","formatted_time":"28 Oct 2016, Fri, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-28T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-28T14:00:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.31898,"longitude":103.89464}]}

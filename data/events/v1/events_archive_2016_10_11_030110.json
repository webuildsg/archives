Feeling frustrated when your neighbour complains of your TV/ movies or gaming being too loud? \n\nPart II \nCommon evaluation criteria for acoustics: How do professionals measure sound isolation as well as sound quality? What are the standards used? \n\nPart III \nImprove the sound quality of your hifi/ home theatre sound system: Wondered why the expensive speakers you bought didn't sound the same as when you listened at the showroom? Your friend's cheap speakers actually sound better than your expensive ones? \n\nSpeaker\nIan Tan\nAfter being offered his first job as a professional sound engineer at the age of 18, Ian built his first professional recording studio at the age of 22, utilizing advanced concepts of acoustic and AV systems design which are ahead of his time. He went on to build professional recording studios and hifi rooms for others, honing his skills in the control of sound transmission between rooms and the acoustical quality of the room itself.\nLater on, he co-pioneered a new mastering technology called FINEDISC with renowned audiophile specialist Mr. Joe Lee that rivaled industry leader JVC’s XRCD. After completing his musical studies in Jazz keyboards, he worked in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA) for 6 years as a performer, educator and sound consultant/ engineer.\nTo further his knowledge and skills, he studied under the wing of renowned acoustic consultant, Dr. Octavio Inacio (Portugal), familiarizing himself with both US and European standards for room acoustics.\nKnown for his problem-solving abilities, he has resolved many difficult acoustical problems that most acousticians could not. Over his 15 years of experience in sound, ian currently holds a perfect record in terms of customer satisfaction and all his projects has achieved high acoustical standards. With a strong passion for sound and strong belief in the importance of good acoustics, he is dedicated to push the local standards in Singapore further to match those in US and Europe.\n\nRegister Here\nhttps://www.eventbrite.sg/e/creative-crew-talks-oct-meeting-2016-tickets-28255116815","location":"Toa Payoh Public Library, 6 Toa Payoh Central, Singapore 319191","rsvp_count":13,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/events/1690582161162582","group_id":"14431580201","group_name":"Creative Crew Singapore","group_url":"http://www.facebook.com/14431580201","formatted_time":"11 Oct 2016, Tue, 7:00 pm","start_time":"2016-10-11T11:00:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-11T12:30:00.000Z","platform":"facebook","latitude":1.33425,"longitude":103.85046},{"id":"234320662","name":"Sharing And Networking Session - An Evening With VueJS","description":"Program 7:15-7:30 Registration • 7:30-8:00 Topic 1: Quick Introduction To VueJS (Bring your laptops &amp; tethering if you want some hands-on) - Aaron • 8:00-8:15 Topic 2: Production Deployment On Azure - Gerald • 8:15-8:30 Topic 3: HTTP/2 Intro, Set up on ExpressJS, Test - Aaron • 8:30-8:35 Announcements (Looking for co-organizers, speakers) • 8:35 Refreshments &amp; Networking \n\n\n\nTopic 1 Requirements: • Laptop and internet connection \n\n\nTopic 3 Requirements: • Laptop and internet connection • NodeJS • Self-signed SSL Certs • Curl (optional)","location":"22CF12, Level 22, Microsoft Singapore, Singapore 018989, One Marina Boulevard","rsvp_count":25,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Full-Stack-Developer/events/234320662/","group_id":19593085,"group_name":"Singapore Full Stack Developer","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Full-Stack-Developer","formatted_time":"11 Oct 2016, Tue, 7:15 pm","start_time":"2016-10-11T11:15:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-11T13:15:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.282387,"longitude":103.85244},{"id":"234285965","name":"Composable Folds","description":"Fold is a folklore abstraction to operate on \"Foldable\" data types in functional programming. They abstract away general pattern for recursing over those types. But it usually is awkward to combine two different folds together. In this session, I will talk about how we can compose folds (by introducing a 'Fold' type) in a cleaner way (by exploiting it's Applicative nature). I will also introduce my in progress library: composable-scala-folds, which implements the same technique to compose folds. I will also talk about the batteries included in that library for basic folds and their implementations.  Speaker: Amar About the speaker:   Programming languages enthusiast. Currently writing Haskell for Capital Match.","location":"ThoughtWorks office, 87B Amoy Street, Level 3, Singapore","rsvp_count":51,"url":"http://www.meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers/events/234285965/","group_id":12690122,"group_name":"Singapore Scala Programmers","group_url":"http://meetup.com/Singapore-Scala-Programmers","formatted_time":"11 Oct 2016, Tue, 7:30 pm","start_time":"2016-10-11T11:30:00.000Z","end_time":"2016-10-11T13:30:00.000Z","platform":"meetup","latitude":1.283051,"longitude":103.848541}]}
